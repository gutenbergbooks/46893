</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_8 c011'     >It is the small boy who crawls under the circus
tent who most keenly enjoys the show.</p>

<p class='c000' >He has watched while the big double-top canvas
was being raised and staked taut, transforming
the familiar pasture-lot into a magic
realm, more alluring and seductive than the best
fishing-hole in the town creek.</p>

<p class='c000' >Following the parade, a cavalcade of golden
chariots, caparisoned horses and swaying elephants,
the small boy has walked on air, buoyed
by the thump and blare of the brass band.
Weeks before he had reveled in every detail of
the show as revealed in posters on the barn-doors:
the lady with the fluffy skirts bounding
through the paper hoops from the well-rosined
back of her white horse; the merry, painted
clown; the immaculate ringmaster in glistening
boots; and, last of all, the showman!—generous,
genial and big of heart, whose plain black cravat,
fitted neatly under his collar as in the lithographs,
and whose beaming blue eye seemed an
open guaranty of all he promised at the single
price of admission.</p>

<p class='c000' >Should the small boy grow up to be a connoisseur
in much that glitters in life besides
golden chariots, and yet manage to keep young
enough to preserve a kindly feeling toward the
lady of perennial youth upon the white horse,
should boyish love of the picturesque still abide
in him, he will find within the gates of Paris a
city after his own heart, a place where gaiety
never ceases, where the finesse of amusement
has been brought almost to a state of perfection.</p>

<p class='c000' >To this great pleasure-ground the whole world
flocks for amusement. It is upon this exquisitely
fashioned spider-web of Europe that many rare
butterflies have beaten their pretty wings to
tatters, and in it that many an old wasp has entangled
itself and died.</p>

<p class='c000' >Paris! the polished magnet which attracts the
spare change of countless thousands in payment
for the wares of folly and fashion, of the dressmaker
and the cook!</p>

<p class='c012' >When the sun shines, the city is <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en fête</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000' >Rows of geraniums flame in the well ordered
gardens of the Tuileries. Masses of flowers,
gay in color as the ribbons streaming from the
bonnets of the nurses, lie in brilliant patches
along gravel walks or within the cool shadow of
massive architecture. Brown-legged children, in
white socks and white dresses fresh from the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blanchisseuse</span></i>, run screaming after runaway hooples,
or watch in silent ecstasy the life and exploits of
Mr. Punch at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre Guignol</span>.</p>

<p class='c000' >Under a vault of turquoise sky the Alexander
Bridge, emblazoned with its golden horses,
spans the Seine, crowded with traffic sweeping
beneath the great arc. Sturdy steam-tugs with
vermilion funnels tow long sausage-like lines of
newly varnished canal-boats, whose sunburned
captains with their sweethearts or families
lounge at <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</span></i> under improvised awnings
stretched from the roofs of cabins shining in
fresh paint. Down the great vista of the Seine
each successive bridge is choked with thousands
of hurrying ant-like humanity. Swift <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bateaux-mouches</span></i>
dart back and forth to their floating stations.
For a few sous these small steamers will
take you to St. Cloud or beyond, past feathery
green islands, past small rural cafés perched upon
grassy banks where all day long old gentlemen
wearing white socks and Panama hats wait
patiently for a stray nibble.</p>

<p class='c000' >This bright morning in Paris the boulevards
are crowded with a passing throng which is
gazed at for hours by those who fill the terraces
of the cafés to linger over a morning <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">apéritif</span></i>.
At one café a party of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">commerçants</span></i> are transacting
business.</p>

<p class='c000' >It is the fat cognac merchant now who is
gesticulating to the rest of the group, pausing
at intervals to wipe the perspiration from his
oily neck. Near them, four Arabs, swathed in
spotless burnooses, their bare feet encased in
sandals, sip in silence their steaming <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petites
tasses</span></i> of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">café Maure</span></i>. Omnibuses lumber by.
The air is vibrant with strident cries and the
cracking of whips. An automobile passes, sputtering
and growling through the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</span></i> of the
broad boulevard, taking advantage of every
chance space as it threads its way out to the
green country beyond with its begoggled occupants
to <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</span></i> at Poissy or perchance to dash
farther on at a devilish pace to the sea and
Trouville.</p>

<p class='c000' >At another table on the terrace is a pretty
blonde, her dainty feet resting in high-heeled
slippers upon the little wooden footstool which
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</span></i> has so thoughtfully tucked under
them, and her eyes shaded by the brim of the
reddest of hats. She is engrossed in writing a
note, which she finally slips in its envelope.
Then this dainty <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parisienne</span> calls the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chasseur</span></i>,
that invaluable messenger attached to every big
café, and gives him a few cautionary parting instructions.
He springs upon his bicycle and in
half an hour returns with another envelope, this
one plain and unaddressed and containing a
hastily scribbled line in pencil. The corners of
the pretty mouth curl upward in a little satisfied
smile as the answer is read.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame</span> was in,” explains the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chasseur</span></i> in a
low voice. “It was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span>’s maid who wrote
it for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>!”</p>

<p class='c012' >An hour later, in quite a different café, in a
jewel-box of a Louis XVI. room, a well-groomed
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span> gazes in adoration across the snow-white
cloth of a breakfast table at a wealth of
golden hair, a pair of blue eyes and what is now
the sauciest of little mouths. The scarlet hat
has been tenderly laid upon the Louis XVI.
clock, its brim discreetly covering the dial. The
aged <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</span></i> allotted to these indiscreet people
has just served the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors-d’oeuvre</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000' >There are many other just such <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuners particuliers</span></i>
in Paris over which no one bothers
oneself.</p>

<p class='c000' >A long line of carriages is ascending the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Champs-Élysées</span>. Here and there among them
you will see the glitter of smart turnouts. In
the cool <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bois</span> nearby, the deer from their noon-day
hiding-places hear the trot of equestrians
passing in the feathery alleys. Upon some
grassy corner of the wood a family party have
spread themselves and laid out their bread,
cheese and wine for a day’s outing. Like a yellow
pearl shimmering far up in the azure, a balloon
sails briskly toward Vincennes.</p>

<p class='c000' >All these things happen when the sun shines.
When it rains, Paris is in mourning. Cozy corners
of café interiors are sought. Here, at least,
one can forget for the time the chill, rain-swept
city. Somber <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiacres</span></i>, drawn by dejected steeds,
splash along the glistening wood pavements,
with hoods up, their occupants stowed under
huge waterproof aprons, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cocher</span></i> muffled in his
coat to the edge of his yellow, glazed hat.</p>

<p class='c000' >Susanne, she of the madonna-like eyes, and
the painter—their small stove, with its pipe
traversing the ceiling, having failed dismally to
warm even the cat beneath it—have come from
their apartment across the Seine to the café, and
are snug in a corner over a game of dominoes.
The café is a refuge in raw, dreary weather.
Only the wretchedly poor must needs pass by its
welcome door. Now and then one does pass: an
outcast, pale and hopeless, wrapping her soaking
skirts about her shrunken hips with something
of her old-time grace; or a man with matted
hair, hungry and bitterly cold. Last night, after
running a mile behind a closed cab with a trunk
strapped on top, he had had the good luck to
stagger beneath its weight up five flights of
stairs, for which service he had received a
franc. He had rushed with it down the winding
stairs to the street. Ah, he remembered
how happy he was!—how drunk and warm he
had been for ten hours! And so among the
cheerlessness of leaden roofs and deserted
streets the smile of the city has gone.</p>

<p class='c000' >Suddenly there is a break in the dull gray
overhead and the downpour ceases.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah! Sapristi!</span></i> It is going to clear!” predicts
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon de café</span></i>, as he glances up at the scudding
clouds, and nods his assurance to those
within. Instantly the café becomes animated
with good humor. A tall man and a brunette in
new high-heeled shoes are the first to venture
out. They laugh over the incident of the rain
very much as those who have luckily escaped an
accident.</p>

<p class='c000' >In half an hour the boulevards are steaming in
warm sunshine. Again the crowd pours by. All
Paris is smiling.</p>

<p class='c000' >If you are an epicure with a fortune, you will
find restaurants whose interiors are marvels of
refinement and good taste, whose cellars hold
priceless wines, and whose cuisines would grace
the table of a king; or, if you are a bohemian,
there is good-fellowship and a cheering dish
awaiting you at a price within the means of
even poets and dreamers. But it is after one
dines that Paris throws open the doors of her
varied attractions. There are the ever-moving
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fêtes foraines</span></i>—mushroom growths of tawdry
side-shows springing up in the different <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quartiers</span>
in a night—with their carrousels and menageries,
and the smarter circuses, like the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cirque Médrano</span>, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nouveau Cirque</span> and the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cirque d’Hiver</span>. There are the cheap shows of
the small <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bouis-Bouis</span>, and the big open-air café
concerts of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Champs-Élysées</span>, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Concert
des Ambassadeurs</span> and the Alcazar d’Été, and
that exquisite music-hall, the Folies Marigny, the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jardin de Paris</span>, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Folies Bergère</span>, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Casino
de Paris</span> and the Olympia, and, in contrast to
these, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Opéra</span>, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Opéra Comique</span> and the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bouffes Parisiennes</span>. There are serious concerts
and little serious concerts like the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Concert
Rouge</span>. There are the shows and cabarets of
Montmartre and those of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rive gauche</span></i>, the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Noctambules</span>, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grillon</span>. There are the
cheap dramas of the bourgeois theaters in remote
quarters of the city, and the risqué plays
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Palais Royal</span>; the daring, independent
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre Libre</span>, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Châtelet</span>, famous for its
scenic wonders; the lighter plays of the day at
the Vaudeville, interpreted by Réjane; the
splendid new theater of the divine Sarah; and
the historic <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Français</span>, with its finished acting in
perfect French. The list is endless.</p>

<p class='c000' >Where shall it be? To roar with the rest at
the latest song of Polin or listen to a sadder tale
at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Odéon</span>, or, perchance, enjoy your second
cigar in the front row under the sparkling eyes
and pert nose of that most charming <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chanteuse</span></i>,
Odette Dulac, at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boîte à Fursy</span>!</p>

<p class='c000' >If you have finished your liqueur and have
retained the enthusiasm of the small boy who
squirmed his way into the circus tent, raise your
finger at a passing <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cocher</span></i>. He will take you
anywhere.</p>

If you wish to buy your
tickets in advance for
the evening performance
at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Alcazar
d’Été</span>, the open-air café
concert of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Champs-Élysées</span>,
you go there
some afternoon, and are
ushered by a waiter
through a narrow corridor of the adjoining restaurant,
past little rooms, shining in copper pots
and pans, and pungent with steaming sauces,
through a pair of swinging doors well worn by
hurrying waiters, and into a square room piled
high with snow-white linen, pyramids of lump
sugar, and rows of glittering silver. Half hidden
in a corner among this spotless collection you
discover a desk presided over by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span>, who
greets you pleasantly and produces for your inspection
from beneath a litter of dinner checks
and bills the seating diagram of the Alcazar.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Does Monsieur wish seats for the evening,
and in what location?” <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span> asks.</p>

<p class='c000' >You suggest two in the third row.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon</span></i>,” replies <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span>, approvingly. She
dips a pen in violet ink and writes carefully upon
a checklike document the numbers of the chosen
seats, tears this check from its stub, blots it, and
scratches the corresponding numbers from the
diagram. “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voilà, Monsieur</span></i>,” and she hands
you your ticket. Then she dives into the pocket
of her petticoat for the key to a money-drawer
from which to make your change. Finally, as
you raise your hat to go, she adds, in parting
assurance, with a little shrug of her shoulders
beneath her worsted shawl: “I am sure <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span>
will find the seats excellent; I should have
chosen them myself.”</p>

<p class='c000' >All this takes time, but I must confess that I
like the pantry method better than having my
change blown at me through the pigeon-window
of a draughty box-office, with the last rear
seats in the house slapped out to me, all the
desirable ones being in the mercenary hands of
a band of sidewalk pirates.</p>

<p class='c000' >Meanwhile, several newcomers are crowding
about the table, among them three well-groomed
men in top hats and frock coats, evidently having
strolled over from their club, and a faultlessly
dressed old baron, with a tea rose in his
button-hole, who is now leaning over the desk,
poring over the diagram through his black-rimmed
monocle.</p>

<p class='c000' >It is the first night of the new <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i>. This
well-fed old baron! His beard is grizzled now
and his bald pate shines beneath the rim of his
stove-pipe hat. How many <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revues</span></i> has he seen
in his Parisian life! How many capricious
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débutantes</span></i> of café concerts and the theater has
he known! How many has he seen flash into
brilliant stars and then grow old and fade away!
Some of them are staid old <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concierges</span></i> now
knitting away the short remnant of their lives.
Some of them died young as roses will under
gas-light. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les petites femmes!</span></i> Ah! the good
old days of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Palais Royal</span>! The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Orangerie</span>!
or the Tuileries and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jardin Mabille</span>! The
days of brocades, of cashmeres, and pendent
jewelry of malachite and old mine diamonds!
What famous beauties then! and how they
could wear their flounces and furbelows—the
little minxes! What a reckless riot of costly
gaiety! How much baccarat at the clubs! How
many suppers at Bignon’s and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maison
Dorée</span>! How many years of all this! and yet
on this sunny afternoon this old baron is as
eager as a schoolboy over the new burlesque,
and so he strolls out with his ticket up the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Champs-Élysées</span>, stopping for a full half hour to
watch the Guignol and the children and the
nurses. Later you will see him rolling through
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bois</span> in his victoria, a queenly woman in
black by his side, the tea-rose stuck jauntily
under the turquoise collar of a sleek red spaniel
in her lap. The baron is smoking. There is no
conversation.</p>

<p class='c000' >You will hear Polin at the Alcazar. He comes
on at the end of a preliminary program of excellent
variety before the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i>. Fat jolly old
Polin, whose song creations portray the happy-go-lucky
lot of the common soldier. He reels in
from the wings, convulsed with laughter over
some recent adventure, the result of which has
put him in the guard-house for ten days. He is
fairly bursting his red-trousered uniform with
merriment as he begins his first verse. He tells
you every detail of his experience, painfully even,
for he is now crying with laughter, his voice
rising in little squeaks like the water in a pump
and bubbling over as he reaches the point. He
is manipulating the while a red cotton handkerchief,
which is never still; now it mops his
round genial face, now it is twisted nervously
into a rope and jammed into his trousers’ pocket,
and as speedily taken out to dust his knees.
His last verse is smothered in chuckling glee;
little jets of cleverly chosen words manage,
however, to get over the footlights to his
listeners. The song ends amid a thunder of
applause and Polin bows awkwardly and retreats
with his back to the audience, his cavalry boots
combined with his red trousers flopping as he
goes.</p>

<p class='c000' >Parisians delight in caricature. It is as inborn
with them as the art of pantomime. The
political topic of the day, a new phase of the
law or the government, the latest scandal, all
come to the net of the writers of these <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revues</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000' >Eve, the daughter of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Humbert</span>, that
shrewdest of modern swindlers, is presented
as a Juno-like creature of lisping innocence.
Shrewd, politic and extravagant <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Humbert</span>,
the brains of that colossal robbery of
millions of francs, steps on the stage. The
brother, Daurignac, who posed as a painter, and
the famous empty safe which played such an
important role in the Humbert <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ménage</span></i>, have been
the theme for a dozen clever burlesques.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Apaches</span>,” a notorious band of cutthroats,
who have lately infested Paris, and
their beautiful accomplice, known as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Casque
d’Or</span>, a term befitting her wealth of golden hair,
have also furnished a well-worn topic for the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i> writers. So, too, the capture of Miss
Stone has inspired a clever <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i>, containing a
whole stageful of pretty and shapely brigands.
The book is by de Cottens and the music by
Henri José, and it is presented in six tableaux at
the Marigny with that idol of Paris, Germaine
Gallois, in the principal role.</p>

<p class='c000' >The Parisian <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i> is in structure traditionally
ever the same, and the receipt for these
musical puddings is never altered. There are
two important characters which are never to be
departed from—the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">commère</span></i> and the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">compère</span></i>.
The first fifteen minutes are occupied with the
introduction of a young man of leisure, the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">compère</span></i>, who has just inherited a colossal fortune
from a dying uncle. He brings with him
an exaggerated outfit of clothes, all brand new,
consisting of a sack suit of dove gray, lined with
red satin; a voluminous red satin tie to match
the suit, clasped with a heavy turquoise-studded
ring; a gold-buttoned embroidered vest; a soft
gray felt traveling hat; lemon kid gloves, and a
rattan cane. He stalks about the stage, smiling—the
stage picture of good health—and
squaring his shoulders and curling the ends
of his long mustache with that debonair air
supposed to be consistent with good luck. His
ecstasy over what fortune has bestowed upon
him would put in the shade even the enthusiasm
of the “found at last!” gentlemen of the Eureka
advertisements.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">GERMAINE GALLOIS</span> OF THE MARIGNY</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c000' >Before he gets half way down the village
street of the first act, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">commère</span></i>, a statuesque
fairy queen in silk tights, with real gems that
are the talk of Paris, who has been hunting for
him all over the town, suddenly comes upon him
in the village square, and, touching him with her
wand, makes him her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000' >The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">compère</span></i> may come upon the stage as
an old <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roué</span></i>, weighted with years and careworn.
In this case, the good fairy immediately
bestows upon him joyous youth and the satin
apparel. She is running over with benefactions
and, causing to appear suddenly a score of
comely young grisettes and hard-working peasant
girls who have been loitering around the
town pump, arrayed in silk hose of assorted
lengths, she urges him to select from these his
mate. Just at this moment a plain little seamstress,
in passing, runs into this barricade of
village beauties, and at once becomes the victim
of their badinage. Our youthful Crœsus, seeing
her distress, straightway chooses her for his
bride, amid the discontented reproaches of the
rest of the girls and to the inward satisfaction of
the good fairy.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A COMMÈRE</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class='c000' >The plain little seamstress turns out to be
superlatively beautiful, and as naïve and witty as
she is charming, especially if it is Lise Fleuron
who plays the part.</p>

<p class='c000' >It takes only a short time, in the second act,
to clothe this stray Cinderella in a Paquin or a
Worth creation, while her old gray and white
clothes are neatly folded and laid away in the
basket with which that very morning she had
started early to market to buy a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poulet</span></i> and a
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salade</span></i> for her sick grandmama. After this
public shopping the happy pair is ready to start
upon the honeymoon. Cinderella adds to her
wardrobe a blue silk parasol, stuck in a rolled up
traveling rug, while her happy companion decorates
himself with a field-glass and dons an
English shooting hat of impossible plaids.</p>

<p class='c000' >In the third act they are joined by the good
fairy and the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i> passes before them. This
is a hodgepodge of burlesques upon the topics
of the day, ballets representing flowers and perfumes
and the history of fashion, and choruses
representing the different journals, the arts,
inventions and manufactures. The costumes
are superb and the massing of color exquisite.</p>

<p class='c000' >Before the finale, an apotheosis of gorgeous
color, with a stageful of kicking, giggling, romping
gaiety, I catch a glimpse of the old baron.
He has bowed to someone on the stage and is
applauding vigorously. So, too, is the young
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vicomte</span></i> with a scar across his cheek where a
ball ploughed itself one chilly morning on the
outskirts of Surennes, all on account of just such
a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cocotte</span></i> as the good fairy who is now glancing
under her stenciled eyelids at a swarthy little
Italian in the front row.</p>

<p class='c000' >And the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comte de B——</span> is shouting “Bravo!”
from his box. It is he who has paid so highly
to see Ninette included nightly in the program.
She has been permitted by the amiable management,
after the transfer of certain crisp bank-notes
from the purse of the count to the pocket
of the manager, to announce, in the third act,
the approach of the soldiers, “as a personal
favor to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comte</span> and because <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame</span> is so
beautiful.” To be in a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i> and flattered by
the press is as necessary to Ninette as to have a
new gown for the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grand Prix</span></i>. For, tho she is
fair to look upon and has little bills springing up
along the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue de la Paix</span> as thick as a field of
bachelor’s-buttons, Ninette is not an actress.
But Ninette enjoys her theatrical career. She
takes the stage seriously, enjoying even the
rigid discipline, because of its complete novelty.
The old playgoers come to her salon, gravely
kiss the tips of her fingers, and tell her how
charming she has been in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i>. Then the
journalists! Ah! how amiable they are! For
the crisp bank-notes of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comte</span> which placed
the crown of Thespis upon the blond head of
Ninette did not all of them go into managerial
pockets. But Ninette has begun to sing;
listen! Yes, it is the line faintly announcing the
soldiers. A final chorus, the curtain falls and
the crowd rises and pours slowly out under the
trees.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>A BEAUTY OF THE REVUE</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c000' >It is starlight. Passing and repassing like
fire-flies the cabs go trundling by. Here and
there in the shadow one is stopped and a fluff of
lace and sheen of silk is bundled in. The baron
walks home, the end of his cigar glowing cheerily.
The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i> is a success.</p>

<p class='c000' >The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Concert des Ambassadeurs</span> with its <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i>
and variety adjoins the Alcazar. One can dine
leisurely on the balconies of either of the two
restaurants adjoining these cafés, and watch the
performance during dinner.</p>

<p class='c000' >Near by is the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jardin de Paris</span> enclosed by
lattice and hedge, and ablaze at night with
festoons of colored lights and crimson lanterns.
Within, the crowd pours round the promenade
thronged with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-mondaines</span></i>, in décolleté gowns
flashing in jet, in picture hats flaming in scarlet,
their white hands glittering to the knuckles in
showy rings. Some of these women are pretty
and gowned in chic simplicity, some of them are
coarsely bedizened and heavily rouged, with
small cruel eyes and strident voices.</p>

<p class='c000' >The variety performance at the end of the
garden has just ended, and a fanfare of hunting
horns announces the quadrille. The passing
throng crowds about the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">estrade</span></i> to watch the
dancing. Another fanfare from the horns, and
the orchestra commences a lively can-can. The
crowd presses close against the low balustrade.
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grille d’Égout</span>” gathers up her skirts, and a
second later her black stockings are silhouetted
in billows of cheap <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lingerie</span></i>. The band crashes
on. The other dancers execute <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas seuls</span></i> with
their traditionally voluminous display, which,
from its very boldness, is neither suggestive nor
vulgar—it is if anything rather a common exhibition
from which all illusion has vanished.
They are a type unto themselves, these can-can
dancers; half of them might easily pass
for middle-aged housemaids, but there are
some who unmistakably have been gathered
from the riff-raff of such places as the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ange
Gabriel</span>” and the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabaret</span></i> of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rat Mort</span>” in
Montmartre.</p>

<p class='c000' >An old man in a long coat of rusty black and
a straight-brimmed top hat now joins the quartet.
He is tall, square-jawed and clean-shaven,
with twinkling gray eyes. He is seventy years
old and has been a professional quadrille dancer
all his life. Laying the smoldering stump of his
cigarette in a safe corner of the balustrade, he
flings himself into the measure. His gaunt
Mephistophelian frame seems tireless as if
hardened by the dancing of a lifetime. He
executes with a certain precision and gravity
the steps of a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas seul</span></i>. When he finishes, he
recovers the butt of his cigarette, smiles sardonically
at the applauding crowd, and sits down to
refresh himself over a “bock.” “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grille d’Égout</span>,”
passing, good-humoredly tips his hat sideways
with the toe of her slipper, and his satanic
majesty rises and leads her into a maze of steps,
evidently in revenge, since she begs off, exhausted
at the end of a quarter of an hour. The
crowd cheers.</p>

<p class='c000' >A shooting-gallery pops and cracks away at
one end of the promenade, while next to it a
much-mirrored bar dispenses so-called English
and American drinks, villainous all, with a bottle
of warm champagne, on tap and sold by the
glass, as a questionable alternative.</p>

<p class='c000' >Below the level of the garden, almost immediately
under the orchestra, is the Crypte, where
there are varied attractions.</p>

<p class='c000' >There are two ways of getting down to this
Crypte; one is by the stairs, and the other by a
polished board-chute. Both are free, but the
chute is the more popular. Here an amused
crowd stands about waiting for some Mimi or
Cora or Faustine to plant her neat patent leather
boots on the board and slide to the subterranean
regions beneath. Here there are living pictures,
two pink samples of which stand guard at the
entrance of this side-show, while within, a gray-haired
pianist thumps out the incidental music
to the tableaux from an ancient piano with a
sleighbell tone.</p>

<p class='c000' >At intervals the sentinels without change
guard with Spring and Summer, while Autumn
and Winter pass the hat, and Venus rising from
the Sea tarries in the dressing-room to curl her
hair and gossip with the leading victims of the
Deluge.</p>

<p class='c000' >Certain tremulous cries emerge from the other
side of the Crypte to the accompaniment of a
desert tom-tom and the tread and sway of Oriental
dancing.</p>

<p class='c000' >Yes, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jardin de Paris</span> with all its noise and
glare was built especially to attract most of the
smoking-room list of the incoming ships. It
appeals in some mysterious way to that natural
prey of the Parisian landlord, the traveler who
allows himself to be held as a hostage in exchange
for his pocket-book at one of the large
dismal hotels built solely for his capture. Here
in a heavily upholstered and silent reading-room
he may read the papers and watch other unfortunates
of his kind prowl about him, until at
seven he is ushered by an overbearing <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître
d’hôtel</span></i> into an even more elaborate hall of fame
to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d’hôte</span>, an occasion representing in
gaiety a feast of refugees after a flood. If during
his stay in Paris he has the good fortune to
see anything Parisian he may count himself lucky.</p>

<p class='c000' >The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre Marigny</span> is to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jardin de Paris</span>
what a cozily lit dinner-table glowing in shaded
candles is to a bar-room, aglitter with brass and
glass and electric lights. This jewel-box of a
theater in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Champs-Élysées</span> was fashioned
for all seasons, but in summer it is in full bloom.</p>

<p class='c000' >The approach to it among the trees is much
the same as to the others, only that the roadway
in front is packed at night with private carriages.
Here a Parisian <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">équipage de luxe</span></i> of an
eastern prince crowds a new coupé, with a
rhinestone clock and hidden cases of doeskin
lined with silk, a tiny mirror, a diminutive
powder-puff in a box with a golden top, a little
of this and a little of that. It is the carriage of
Julie la Drôlesse; with this gilt encased arsenal
one feels safe to look one’s best in any emergency
thinks Julie—that is, if Julie ever really
does any thinking. Does the little golden-puff
remind her, I wonder, of the days when two sous
of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poudre de riz</span></i> applied in a jiffy with a corner of
her jupon sufficed to charm the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitués</span></i> of the
Rue Blanche? <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah! mes enfants!</span></i></p>

<p class='c000' >Seen through the trees the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre Marigny</span>
looms like some gigantic flower of light, the
reflection from the edge of its circular promenade
illuminating in a hazy light the surrounding
foliage. And such a promenade!—aglow with
fairy lamps thrust in a setting of shining leaves,
and with comfortable rattan chairs encircling the
mosaic floor which during the intermission is
brilliant with the passing throng.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Mar-ga-rita” sing gayly the Neapolitans to
the strum of guitars. A woman with an olive
skin whose lithe body seems to have been
poured into a delicate mold of Valenciennes lace,
glides by on the arm of a Russian. Her jewels
have bankrupted a prince.</p>

<p class='c000' >Sundry old Frenchmen, in straight-brimmed
hats with ribbons in their button-holes, pass;
one is a senator, another a famous sculptor.
At one’s elbows is a pretty blonde, her white
neck encircled by a band of turquoise reaching
nearly to her small pink ears, ever listening like
tiny shells to the flattering murmur of the
human sea about her.</p>

<p class='c000' >Pop! goes a bottle of champagne in the bar.
Crack! rips the spangled train of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Thérèse</span>
Derval under the clumsy heel of her admirer.
“Fifty louis for your awkwardness, idiot!”
snaps the quick-tempered <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Thérèse</span>.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Mar-ga-rita” strum the guitars. But the
bell is ringing for the curtain. The spectacular
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i> following the excellent variety is quite
different from the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revues</span></i> of the other café
concerts; at the Marigny they are poems of
color—costumes which are the creation of
artists. Nowhere is scenic art brought to a
higher perfection than at the Marigny.</p>

<p class='c000' >One sees a ballet in tones of violet and gray
that is as delicate as an orchid. Again the
stage is blazing in Spanish yellow and red as
rich as a pomegranate crushed in the sun. Now
the tableau changes to a scenic night bathed in
pale moonlight with a ruined <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">château</span></i> harboring
purple shadows and framed in a grove of
cypresses.</p>

<p class='c000' >From this grove may flutter a ballet of bats,
or the summer night may vanish in a twinkling
and in its place appear a garden of Maréchal
Niel roses blooming at a signal into another
ballet.</p>

<p class='c000' >Now enters a procession representing the
history of fashion. Here are the exaggerated
costumes of the Middle Ages, ermine and miniver,
and those impossible head-dresses, the cornettes,
hennins, and escoffions of the time of
“Louis the Fair.” Then follow the grand
apparel of the Medicis, and the transparent
sheath-like tunics of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">merveilleuses</span></i> of the Directory,
slit at the side and fastened with a cameo
brooch, and the toilettes of the balls of the
Restoration. Even more ridiculous costumes
were worn, you remember, by women of society
a hundred years ago openly in this very <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Champs-Élysées</span>,
the days when all Paris went mad over
the costumes of the Athenian maidens. What
a contrast are the creations of the present age to
those seen during the Reign of Terror at Frascati’s!
And yet I am sure that if any of the
celebrated beauties of the Marigny had entered
the court of Louis XVI. in a perfect gown of
to-day, she would have been welcomed with
wonder and delight.</p>

The famous chef, Vatel,
before a dinner
given to Louis
XIV., killed himself
because the fish was
late.</p>

<p class='c000' >Nowadays he might simply
have shrugged his shoulders in
apology, a mode of reply most
popular in France, and against which all argument
is as useless as so much steam in the air.</p>

<p class='c000' >Boil with rage if you will; plead with the ingenuity
of a defending lawyer, or berate him in
language which would inspire renewed effort in
a government mule, the Frenchman’s shrug will
disarm you as neatly as an expert duelist sends
your foil spinning out of your grip, and you will
be conscious of how useless your tirade has
been only when you perceive the delinquent
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span> with the elevated shoulders bowing
himself politely out through the door.</p>

<p class='c000' >A year ago the veteran chef of a celebrated
Parisian restaurant resigned his position. Prices
had been affixed to the menu. With this deplorable
change the famous <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maison</span></i> had sunk
below the dignity of this august personage. To
attach to so noble a creation as a “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">filet d’ours à
la François-Joseph</span></i>” a fixed price as one would
to a pound of butter, made his further connection
with the house an impossibility. “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parbleu!</span></i>”
he cried, “Had Paris become a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gargotte</span></i> for the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand monde</span></i> that he should have lived to see
this?”</p>

<p class='c000' >There still remain a few smart restaurants
where there are no prices on the menu, but even
in these there is a second edition of the bill of
fare with the prices thereon which the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître
d’hôtel</span></i> will apologetically hand you when he
discovers you are neither a millionaire nor a
fool, even tho your French may be not so good
as his own. If you have the leisure, the best
plan is to order your dinner for a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">partie carrée</span></i> in
advance and for a certain fixed sum, as most
Parisians do.</p>

<p>AROUND THE HALLES</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >In no city in the world are there so many and
so varied places to dine as in Paris. One can
hardly look right or left from any corner of any
street and not find restaurants, from little <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boîtes</span></i>,
where a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plat du jour</span></i> and a bottle of wine are to be
had for a few sous, to those whose cuisine and
rare vintages are adapted only to the well-filled
purse of an epicure. There are numberless resorts
frequented by the vast army of bohemians,
some the rendezvous for students and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grisettes</span></i>,
others for the poets, the pensive, long-haired
devotees of the symbolistic school, and kindred
souls in the realm of art. There are those
patronized by jolly, devil-may-care young doctors,
sleepless night-owls, who discuss till graying
dawn their latest operations with a complacent
sense of superiority over the other half
of the human world, who, they are convinced,
without their medical aid would be left as helpless
as a mass of struggling white bait in a net.
And there, too, buried away in the dingy alley
of Montmartre and fringing the ill-reputed
neighborhoods of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Butte</span> and the great
Halles, are the feeding places of thieves, reeking
from the odor of decaying vegetables and bad
cheeses, yet, they say, supplied with some of the
rarest wines.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic003'>

<p>A BUSY MORNING</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >It was a famous French sociologist who declared,
from extended personal investigations of
the private life of the Parisian mendicants, that
the best <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">champagne brut</span></i> he had yet encountered
he had found on the dinner tables of professional
beggars.</p>

<p class='c000' >Along the lighted streets and boulevards are
the great <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brasseries</span></i> for Munich beer and German
dishes, and the richly decorated taverns, some of
them in black oak shining in pewter and ornate
with medieval decoration and stained glass.
These are swarming with eddies from the passing
world until long after midnight. Many of
these are the habitual rendezvous of journalists,
like the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Café Navarin</span>. Others, like the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Café
des Variétés</span> and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Taverne de la Capitale</span>, are
the favorite places for actors, and still others for
painters and musicians. There is hardly a
resort in Paris which has not its distinct <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clientèle</span>,
from the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">buvettes</span></i> of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cochers</span></i> to Maxime’s.</p>

<p class='c000' >And of soberer kind are the innumerable,
perfectly kept establishments created by Duval
and imitated by Boulant. They are big places
for small purses; everything is of excellent
quality, well cooked, and served by respectable
women in spotless white caps and aprons.</p>

<p class='c000' >There are hundreds of other restaurants besides,
with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dîners</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuners</span></i> at a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prix fixe</span></i>, in
which a secondary quality of
food is turned into a clever
imitation of the best, and
where the wine is plain and
harmless and included with
a course dinner <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au choix</span></i> for
two francs fifty and less. On
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span></i> days and Sundays these
well patronized <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits dîners
de Paris</span></i> are crowded with
bourgeois folk: clerks with
their sweethearts, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">commerçants</span></i>
and their families, economical bachelors,
and others, frugal-minded, from out of Paris
who have come into the metropolis to spend a
long-anticipated holiday.</p>

<div class='imgleft c014'   >
 <img src='images/i_045.jpg' alt='' class='c015' />
</div>

<p class='c000' >And in contrast to all these dining places are
the smart restaurants, filled with the correct
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand monde</span></i> and the chic <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-monde</span></i>—the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Café de
Madrid</span>, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maison Anglaise</span>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Paillard</span>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arménonville,
La Rue, Joseph, Ledoyen, Voisin</span> and
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Café de Paris</span>. There are serious old places,
such as the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tour d’Argent</span>, plain and unadorned,
where all the wealth is in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">casserolles</span></i> and the
cobwebbed bottles. Then, too, there is the
ancient <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Restaurant Foyot</span>, with its <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clientèle</span> of
senators, academicians and military officers, and
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Restaurant La Pérouse</span> on the quay of the
Seine, where resort savants and magistrates and
others less grave—an old-fashioned place with a
narrow stairway leading to quaint, low-ceiled
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabinets particuliers</span></i> and excellent things simmering
over the kitchen fires below stairs and certain
rare old Burgundy lining the walls of the cellar.</p>

<p class='c000' >Just such a place of seclusion and good cooking
is the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Père La Thuille</span>” in Montmartre. It
is often a pleasure to dine in a room devoid of
gilt and tinsel. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Père La Thuille</span> is restful
in this respect. The cuisine is perfect and the
wine very old.</p>

<p>THE KITCHEN OF A CHEAP TABLE D’HÔTE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >At one of the tables in the rectangular dining-room
a celebrated diva whose bodice glitters in
gems is dining with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>, the aged director
of a gas company. Several empty tables away
another elderly gentleman is filling <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle
Fifi</span>’s glass of champagne. Half hidden in
another corner of the long leather settee a lady
with delicate features and frank, intelligent eyes
pours forth her soul and the remainder of a bottle
to a well-groomed man at her side. The light
from the shaded candles shows more clearly his
strong fine hands. Now the little finger of his
companion touches his seal ring quite unconsciously,
as one would give an accent by a
gesture to a confession. For a moment he covers
her tiny hand with his own. Poor devil! he
must return to his regiment to-morrow and,
what is still sadder, the lady is married.</p>

<p class='c000' >The New York Dairy Lunch, with its mirrored
and marbled bathroom decoration, its elevating
Bible texts, and depressing “sinkers,” and its
dyspeptic griddle-cakes cooked in the window,
would never make a success with Parisians.
One of the most doleful sights I have seen in
Paris was a sad-looking gentleman in black
sitting at a cold marble-topped table of an expensive
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patisserie</span></i> lunching on a weak cup of tea
and a plate of cream-puffs—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chacun son goût!</span></i></p>

<p class='c000' >There exist here, however, “Express Bars”
along the boulevards, where by dropping two
sous in a slot you are permitted to rob the
nickel-plated chicken house installed beneath of
any of a dozen different articles, from a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">baba au
rhum</span></i> to a glass of beer. But Parisians stop at
these places very much as they would to hear a
phonograph, or as French children stop for their
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">goûter</span></i> at four o’clock in the cake shops, or as men
and women of all classes drop in for the celebrated
fruits in spirits dispensed at the famous
solid silver bar of La Mère Moreau.</p>

<p class='c000' >The French never hurry over dinner. The
pleasure of dining must not be spoiled by haste.
It is an hour which nothing postpones. If anything
serious is to be decided upon, Parisians
dine first and then think the matter over. Perhaps
after all they are right, for are
we not at our best in heart and spirit
when we have dined wisely? Anger,
hatred, even the green
monster jealousy, fade
away with the progress
of a good dinner.</p>

<p class='c000' >Into the Restaurant
Weber comes an old <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon-vivant</span></i>
growling. He
stands for a brief moment
surveying the tables,
chooses one of the few unoccupied ones and
plants himself savagely in front of the snow-white
cloth. “The devil!” he mutters to himself.
“She’ll get my letter to-morrow. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon Dieu!</span></i>
to think I have been imbecile enough to trust
her!”</p>

<p class='c000' >“Has <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur le comte</span> ordered?” interrupted
quietly the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître d’hôtel</span></i> Léon.</p>

<p class='c000' >The count glowers over the menu.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Some <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">filets de hareng saurs</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parfaitement, monsieur</span></i>,” replies Léon, and he
repeats the order to a waiter.</p>

<p class='c000' >There follows a pause, during which the
count’s irate eye (the one not occupied with his
monocle) wanders absently over the list.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Perhaps monsieur would like an excellent
purée of peas to follow?” Léon naïvely suggests.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon!</span></i>” gruffly accepts the comte. “And a
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">homard</span></i>, and a roast partridge with a good salad,
and a bottle of Veuve Clicquot, ’93,” adds the
count.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bien, monsieur</span></i>, I will season the salad myself.”
And Léon, with an authoritative gesture, claps
his hands twice, stirring into increased activity
the already alert waiters, gives a final touch to
the appointments of the count’s table, and hurries
off to attend to another dinner, a jolly party
of four who need no further cheering up.</p>

<p class='c000' >“She has the innocent eyes of a child when
she lies!” mutters the count, returning to his
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c000' >But the tiny <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">filets de hareng</span></i>, with their tang
of the sea, sharpen his appetite, and the wine
quiets his nerves and refreshes his brain, and the
purée warms him and the lobster steaming in its
thick, spicy sauce cheers him. The hatred within
him is growing less. That lump of jealousy
buried so deep half an hour ago has so diminished
that, when the fat little partridge arrives,
garnished and sunk in its nest of fresh watercress,
this gives the fatal <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</span></i> to ill humor. Again
the champagne is rattled out of its cooler. Léon,
whose watchful eye is everywhere and whose
intuition tells him when a patron wishes to talk,
now comes to the count’s table.</p>

<p class='c000' >The count has by this time become the soul of
good humor. He compliments Léon on the
dinner and Léon compliments him on his taste
in selection of viands, and so they talk on until
Léon goes himself for a special liqueur.</p>

<p class='c000' >The count gazes peacefully on those about
him and admires, with the critical eye of a connoisseur
of beauty, the pretty woman at the
corner table. Silent waiters lay the fresh cloth
and bring him an extensive choice of Havanas.
All these final accessories have little by little
taken away the remnants of his ill feeling. He
puffs reminiscently at his cigar. His very spirit
of revenge seems to have been steamed, sautéed
and grilled out of him. Now he takes from his
waistcoat pocket a thin gold watch—the one he
bought at a round sum in Geneva years ago and
which has been faithfully ticking away the
seconds of his turbulent life so long that he has
come to regard it somewhat with awe, as one
would the change from his last dollar.</p>

<p class='c000' >The delicate hands
have crept to nine
o’clock and two tiny
bells within strike the
hour. The count
writes upon his visiting
card a short line,
seals it in its envelope,
calls the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chasseur</span></i> and,
giving him the note,
directs: “Stop on
your way at Véton’s
for the red roses.”</p>

<p class='c000' >Ah, mesdames et

been settled by the doctor with the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cordon bleu</span></i>
and the shining saucepans!</p>

<p class='c000' >The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Taverne Pousset</span> is famous for its beer, its
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écrevisses</span></i> (crawfish boiled scarlet and served
steaming), and its <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soupe à l’ognon</span></i>, a bouillon redolent
with onions and smothered beneath a coverlet
of brown cheese.</p>

<p class='c000' >Parisians flock to Pousset after the theater.
At night its richly decorated interior is ablaze
with light and crowded with those who have
stopped for supper after the play.</p>

<p class='c000' >There are dozens of just such <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tavernes</span></i> and
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brasseries</span></i>. These German institutions have
oddly enough become most popular with the
French, who have grown in recent years critically
fond of good beer. I might add, however,
that it is the only thing German that has become
popular. That little affair of Sedan is still in the
gorge.</p>

<p class='c000' >The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Coq d’Or</span>, on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue Montmartre</span>, is one
of the oldest taverns in Paris. Its <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clientèle</span> during
dinner is composed of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">commerçants</span></i> and a mixture
of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeoisie</span></i> and Bohemia, but after midnight,
as happens in scores of other such places,
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Coq d’Or</span> is filled by a veritable avalanche
of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-mondaines</span></i> of the surrounding quarter.</p>

<p class='c000' >If you dine at Marguery’s, order a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sole au vin
blanc</span></i> and let Étienne bring it to you.</p>

<p class='c000' >If it is summer you will find a table in the
covered portico brilliant with hanging flowers,
or you may choose a snug corner behind the cool
green hedge that skirts the entrance of this
famous rendezvous of rich <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeois</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">commerçants</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000' >The restaurant Marguery is unique. It is a
magnificent establishment, perfect in its cooking,
its wines, and its service. I know of no restaurant
where for this perfect ensemble one pays so
moderate and just a price; the proof of this is
that here you will see the true Parisian; neither
is there any supplementary charge for any of the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabinets particuliers</span></i> or the private dining-rooms.
It is the only <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maison de premier ordre</span></i> I know of
which does not tax one more or less heavily for
the right of seclusion.</p>

<p class='c000' >You will have hardly finished your sole before
a distinguished old gentleman with a decoration
in his lapel and a crumpled napkin in one hand,
will pass your table, bowing graciously to you if
you are a stranger and stopping to say a few
pleasant words if you are a friend. He is slightly
bent with age, massive of frame, with silvery
locks combed back from a broad forehead, and
his face is illumined with kindliness and intelligence.</p>

whom the French government has decorated in
recognition of his skill as a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">restaurateur</span></i>, a man
who still directs personally every detail of this
superb establishment where one can dine for a
few francs with an excellent bottle of wine, or
give a dinner fit for an emperor, including, I
have not the slightest doubt, the famous peacock
tongues should you wish them, and with a choice
of wines from a cellar whose contents are valued
at three millions of francs.</p>

<p class='c000' >In a corner a fat merchant, flushed with a
heavy dinner, is ready for his chat with the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sommelier</span></i>. He tells him with some fervor that he
is proud to say that when he was eighteen he
dined on a sou’s worth of bread on the stones of
<a id='bastille' />the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place de la Bastille</span>. “Men of that time were
ready to begin at the foot of the ladder,” he
continues, puffing at his cigar, “but nowadays
our sons, who see us in comfort, want to obtain
money and luxuries without going through the
mill.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Par ici! monsieur</span></i>,” says Étienne, and he
leads the way up a carved stairway to the floor
above, past little <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabinets particuliers</span></i> whose cozy
interiors are marvels of good taste. Here is one
with walls of rich brocade of the time of Louis
XVI. Another is in early French, with its
adaptation of Chinese ornaments. Another is
paneled in ebony inlaid with mother-of-pearl;
still another in pale lilac brocade and teakwood.
Each of these private rooms has its serving
pantry across a narrow hallway where the linen
and glass and silver are kept spotless, in readiness
at a moment’s notice. A superb private
stairway in white marble and stained glass connects
this portion of the restaurant with a dignified
courtyard leading out to a gray little side
street. But these are the little rooms.</p>

<div class='imgright c014'   >
 <img src='images/i_057.jpg' alt='' class='c015' />

<p class='c000' >There is, besides, a great banquet hall in
medieval Gothic that might have been carried
bodily out of some feudal castle in Touraine
with a carved minstrel gallery, a superb ceiling
and rare stained glass.
Here wedding breakfasts
and dinners are
given with cotillions to
follow. And there are
two other salons paneled
in rare carving and
inlaid woods. At the
bottom of another stairway
Étienne directs me <a id='across' />across the mosaic floor
of a spacious hall and into a grotto-like cave.
Here is another dining-room. It is resplendent
in stalactites with green ferns growing from
walls of moss-grown rocks and a cascade talking
to itself and purling into a green pool.</p>

<p class='c000' >Music? no, indeed. People who come here
have too good a time to need to be waltzed
through the soup or polkaed through the entrée.</p>

<p class='c000' >It is four o’clock and they are laying the round
table in the center of the grotto with twenty
covers. It might be for a state dinner in the
presence of a king, so perfectly is the table appointed
and in such rare taste. A bed of violet
orchids forms the center of the table.</p>

<p class='c000' >I look up and catch sight of the venerable
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Marguery</span> on the stairway, peering
interestedly into the room to watch the laying of
the service. He has suddenly entered through
some hidden door—a panel in the wall which
Étienne afterwards shows me. “He is everywhere,
as you see,” said Étienne, quietly.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Ah! it is you, monsieur,” says <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur
Marguery</span>, cheeringly, as he approaches. “And
have you found this grotto room charming with
the pale orchids and the cool water? You know
in summer,” he continues, “it is quite as cool
here as in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bois</span>”—and he might have added,
quite as beautiful, for this fairy corner needed
only the setting of wit and beauty to make it a
paradise.</p>

<p class='c000' >“And you see, my friend,” he continues, “you
have seen only the upstairs of my restaurant.
Come between seven and eight some evening
and I will put you in a corner of my kitchen
when it is busiest,” and he adds, with smiling
good humor, “I won’t warn them you are
coming.”</p>

<p class='c000' >I was the guest of the chef in the Marguery
kitchen at eight o’clock one Saturday evening.
There were a dozen wedding banquets going
on upstairs, and scores of hidden <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dîners particuliers</span></i>,
while the restaurant, screened from the kitchen
by a swinging door, was filled to overflowing.</p>

<p class='c000' >I passed through this door and met my host
with the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cordon bleu</span></i>, who looked more like the
director of a railroad than a cook. He placed
me in a safe corner connecting the meat room
and the kitchen, from which I could observe and
still be out of the way of the rush, for the famous
cuisine was as busy as a stage during a
spectacle.</p>

<p class='c000' >A long counter ran the length of the room,
serving as a barrier against hurrying waiters.
Back of this counter lay the culinary plant. Five
great ranges were in full blast.</p>

<p class='c000' >At one a cloud of steam rose from some entrée,
on the second range a great copper saucepan was
suddenly lifted and the fire beneath it sent up a
lurid flare which went slipping up the hooded
chimney.</p>

<p class='c000' >The room was in a state of bedlam with the
cries of meat cooks, vegetable cooks, soup cooks
and waiters hurrying for their orders. The
system beneath all this was perfect.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>THE VEGETABLE COOK</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >A waiter sprang through
the swinging door shouting
his order. He never was
forced to repeat it, so alert
were the staff of cooks that
they seemed to have been
awaiting him.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Un Chateaubriand aux
pommes!</span></i>” cries a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</span>.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Un Chateaubriand aux
pommes!</span></i>” corroborates a
chief cook.</p>

<p class='c000' >Instantly a man dodges
out of the meat room, a second
later the steak is sizzling
over the fire, the vegetable
cook stands ready with his potatoes, a
fourth prepares the sauce, a fifth attends to the
plates, and the sixth looks after the garnishing
of the dish.</p>

<p class='c000' >“I am glad you find it interesting,” said my host
the chef, as he joined me for a moment’s rest.</p>

<p class='c000' >I bowed my compliments.</p>

<p class='c000' >“And is this the only kitchen for so large an
establishment?” I ventured, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Yes, the only one; we do it all here. It is
the organization which counts, not the space.
With these five ranges and this force of men we
are competent to handle as many dinners as
come under the roof.”</p>

<p class='c000' >The chef’s eye seemed everywhere. When
the rush was over, his private coupé would call
for him, but at present he was on guard.</p>

<p class='c000' >I marveled at this man’s memory. What a
catalog of sauces, each one containing scores
of ingredients, he must carry in his head! What
a list of dishes, each one prepared in a dozen
different ways! I imparted to him the fact that
my culinary skill was limited to boiling an egg,
and he laughed good-humoredly, his intelligent
face, with its white mustache, glowing under his
white cap in the glare of a nearby fire.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Precisely, monsieur, but you see it is the
same in every profession; one must learn the
minute parts which tend to make something
which in itself pleases, whether it be through
the mind, the pocket, or the stomach,” and, asking
me to excuse him for a moment, he disappeared
in the direction of a cloud of mushroom
steam to overlook an entrée.</p>

<p class='c000' >A cook near me was busy with the final sizzle
of a duck <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en casserole</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000' >The man was an artist in the way he stirred
his sauce. Even in the very handling of the
burnished copper <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">batterie</span></i> of saucepans about him.</p>

<p class='c000' >I fully expected this culinary prestidigitator
would produce the lady’s ring from the duck he
had just finished cooking and discover the rabbit
in my overcoat pocket, but the duck was smothered
so quickly in a rich brown sauce, with a
dash of this and a pinch of that from the magician,
and finally thrust for a final magic touch over the
crackling blaze, that, before I could guess what
might happen next, it was on its way to some
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabinet particulier</span></i>, where a quiet little man with
gray hair was waiting to carve it.</p>

<p class='c000' >It was he who won the grand prize for his
skill in getting sixty slices from a single duck.
He has quite the air of a dignified surgeon who
has been called in consultation.</p>

<p class='c000' >He carves with a plain knife sharpened upon
the back of a plate. The duck seems to fall
apart under his expert touch. He mashes into a
paste the liver and heart, pouring over the whole
the red blood gravy. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voilà!</span></i> It is done; and,
passing the first dish to one of the group of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçons</span> at his elbow who have been watching
him, he bows and leaves the room. The group
of waiters about him are deeply interested in
this object lesson, and it is this willingness to
learn which makes in Paris so many good <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçons
de café</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000' >The famous old Maison Dorée has closed its
doors. The business of this celebrated restaurant
had fallen off so seriously that its death
was but a question of days. Paris had deserted
it in its old age and dined elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000' >Many of the waiters, who had spent their lifetime
beneath its roof, hoped against hope, and
continued to serve the few <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitués</span> who remained
faithful to the end.</p>

<p class='c000' >Occasionally a party of strangers would open
the door, and, finding the restaurant deserted,
close it apologetically and go on their way to a
gayer place.</p>

<p>THE MAGICIAN</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >In encouraging moments like these the veteran
waiters ceremoniously took their places and the
dignified <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître d’hôtel</span></i> advanced to greet the
newcomers bravely, as if the ruin of the old house
were not an open secret. There is something
pathetic about the death of an establishment like
the Maison Dorée.</p>

<p class='c000' >How much gaiety it has seen in its lifetime!</p>

<p class='c000' >How faithfully it has cheered those who entered
its doors!</p>

<p class='c000' >Here the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vie Parisienne</span></i> that Grévin and
Cham drew so inimitably, came to dine in the old
days; the courtezans of Balzac; the belles and
beaux of the Empire.</p>

<p class='c000' >Just as the Maison Dorée lived in thoroughbred
dignity so did it die. Yesterday
morning the shades of the windows
were drawn down. The
end had come. A simple card
on the door bore the
words:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“LE RESTAURANT</div>
    <div>EST FERMÉ.”</div>

threshold.</p>

<p class='re-caption'>Drawn by Sancha</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >On Saturdays the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Café de la Cascade</span>, in
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bois</span>, is taken possession of by <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeois</span></i> wedding
parties, with brides in white satin gowns and
grooms and their friends in dress-suits, which
they had donned early in the morning and in
which they have sung and cheered, and drunk
the bride’s health and the groom’s health, and
that of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les belles soeurs</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les petits</span></i> nephews and
all the innumerable <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enfants</span></i>, cousins and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cousines</span></i>,
comrades and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amis</span></i> connected by blood, marriage
or friendship with the happy pair.</p>

<p class='c000' >No wonder that by midnight, after such a day
of continuous festivity, the poor bride is wild-eyed,
flushed, exhausted and demoralized! For
this <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeois</span></i> wedding had started at ten A. M.
with the civil ceremony at the City Hall, the
civil wedding being the only one legally recognized
in France. From the hall the party proceeded
to the church, where most brides insist
on going after the civil ceremony. Here occurs
another long function, including an address by
the priest or minister. Then the bridesmaids,
accompanied by the men of honor, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçons d’honneur</span></i>,
of which there are three classes, make two
collections among the assemblage: one for the
poor and the other for the church. This procession
is headed by a gorgeously dressed
major-domo, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Suisse</span>,” who pounds the floor
with his heavy baton as he strides solemnly
through the aisles warning everyone to get their
donations ready. The collections referred to
are made either in a butterfly net, which discreetly
hides the sous from view, or in purses
made to match the gowns of the bridesmaids
and carried ostensibly open for the expected
louis.</p>

<p class='c000' >There are several classes of weddings, just as
there are several classes of funerals, their magnificence
progressing in proportion to the money
paid. You can be married at the little altar or
the big one, enter under a spangled canopy at
the front door or by an unadorned modest side
one.</p>

<p class='c000' >Now comes another ordeal for the bride; having
gone to the sacristy after the ceremony, she
is obliged to shake hands with everyone present
and be kissed on both cheeks by cousins, friends
or even acquaintances. Then the procession of
carriages drives up, each being given its precedence
in line. They are filled and start off for
the wedding breakfast at the restaurant. This
means a well-to-do wedding; many couples can
afford only one huge stage which alternately
serves in going to and from the races, while
others go on foot, often six or seven arm-in-arm
romping through the streets, singing or stopping
at some little <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">buvette</span></i> for a glass of wine. The
poor bride walks on and on, holding her satin
train. She is half exhausted, but is expected to
be bright and gay. Poor victim, the day has
only begun for her!</p>

<p class='c000' >After the wedding breakfast at the restaurant,
trains are taken to some nearby country place
like St. Cloud, or carriages to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Café de la
Cascade</span>. Here occurs the indispensable dinner,
a feast of uproarious <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">camaraderie</span></i>, where dishes
succeed dishes, and where each one is expected
to be rollicking and witty and sing his song. In
accordance with an old custom, to the first man
of honor is allotted the privilege of trying to
steal the garter of the bride.</p>

<p class='c000' >The dance which follows this dinner lasts
until morning, and lucky are the bride and
groom if they can escape by midnight.</p>

<p class='c000' >But mild indeed are these <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeois</span></i> weddings of
the city compared with those of the well-to-do
peasants! These include festivities which last
three days, most of which time is spent at table,
where beef is followed by veal, veal by mutton,
mutton by rabbit, rabbit by chicken, and chicken
by pork, and so on through the list of viands.
This continuous feast is only made possible by
consuming from time to time a stiff glass of
applejack.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la mariée!</span></i>” cry a dozen overjoyous ones
in front of a café at St. Cloud as my <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voiture</span></i> tries
to pass. My <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cocher</span></i> grins and cracks his whip.
The best man, a soldier, the groom and a dozen
others, noisy with the sound wine of Touraine,
link arms in front of my rawboned steed, yelling:</p>

<p class='c000' >“You cannot pass, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>, unless you cry
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la mariée!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la mariée!</span></i>” I cry, loudly as I can, in my
ineradicable accent.</p>

<p class='c000' >There is a welcoming shout from the wedding
party. The bride throws me a kiss. The little
cousins and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cousines</span></i> and the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau-frère</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belle-mère</span></i>
wave their handkerchiefs in acknowledgment,
a dozen tumblers of red wine are offered
to me, and as many are thrust at the fat <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cocher</span></i>
who is now waving his glazed hat in the air with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la République! Vive la mariée! Vive la
France!</span></i>” come from a score of throats as I am
allowed to proceed. As we rattle up a crooked
street, the din of the festivity grows fainter and
fainter in the distance, now I hear faintly the indistinct
blare of the band playing below for the
dance, and now and then a cheer, stronger
than the others, floats up from the far-away café:
“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la mariée!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c000' >Dining in the open air is brought to its perfection
in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bois de Boulogne</span>.</p>

<p class='c000' >The Chalet du Touring Club, at the entrance
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bois</span>, is a popular rendezvous for the
bicycling Mimis and the Faustines, and their
admirers. At the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">apéritif</span></i> hour in the afternoon,
this cosmopolitan café under the trees is crowded
with a mixed assemblage. It is an excellent
place in which to breakfast well and at a
moderate price.</p>

<p class='c000' >The Pavillon Chinois, with its picturesque
pagoda-like roof, is frequented by a richer class.</p>

<p class='c000' >During the season, between five and seven, all
of smart Paris may be seen at the Pavillon
d’Armenonville. At this hour the tables in the
garden are filled with pretty women in chic
toilettes, accompanied by faultlessly dressed
gentlemen whose bank accounts have managed
thus far to survive.</p>

<p class='c000' >By six, the scene resembles a garden party.
There is a mixture of nature and artifice, of exquisite
toilettes, of gay flowers blooming in beds
under the shadows of sturdy trees up in whose
branches the birds flutter and sing. One’s ears
are filled with babble of voices and the soft
laughter of those whose life for the moment is
happy. The sun has sunk in an opalescent haze,
its rays reflect upon the glass of the pavilion and
the edge of the tiny kiosks whence come the
chatter and laughter of some jolly <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">partie carrée</span></i>
still at table over a late <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</span></i>. Above the
hum drones the rhythm of the Tziganes; their
violins cry in some plaintive gipsy song. Now
the strings rush into the most seductive of
Viennese waltzes, melting away, to begin afresh
in some mad Hungarian czardas.</p>

<p class='c000' >Smart turnouts and little private victorias
with tinkling bells are constantly arriving and
departing. Now there is a sound of prancing
hoofs and the clink of harness at the entrance of
the garden, and in rumbles a break perfectly
driven by a well-groomed gentleman posed in
faultless style on the box seat. By his side sits
a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parisienne</span> of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parisiennes</span>—from the glossy
undulations of her black hair to the tips of her
tiny patent leather boots, both of which are now
occupied in daintily descending the steps of the
break. She is a famous beauty who sings at
one of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cafés concerts</span></i>, quite young, with pretty
white teeth and an olive skin.</p>

<p class='c000' >Her companion leaves his turnout to the care
of his grooms, and the break with its shining red
wheels rumbles away in the direction of the carriage
shed. The charming brunette is radiant
from the drive; they have been nearly to Poissy
and back. She will now have a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gaufrette</span></i> and a
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coupe de fruits au champagne</span></i>, and the gentleman
who drove so cleverly a cigarette and a long
brandy and soda. This dainty <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parisienne</span> insists
on preparing this “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">drôle de boisson anglaise</span></i>” herself,
and, with a rippling laugh, puts in the ice
and the brandy and then the soda, and, as a final
touch, in a spirit of deviltry, adds a cherry from
her own <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coupe</span></i>, for which archness she is scolded
by her companion, to whom she blows a kiss in
return.</p>

<p>A RESTAURANT ON THE CHAMPS-ÉLYSÉES</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >At eight, the Pavillon d’Armenonville will be
brilliant with a throng of diners—men in spotless
shirt-fronts and women in toilets of lace and
jewels—and crisp notes of the Bank of France
will change hands for rich food and sparkling
wine. The season for these delightful retreats
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bois</span> being short, the rents for them are
exorbitant, and so the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monde</span></i> must pay the fiddler
accordingly.</p>

<p class='c000' >At the end of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bois</span> is the Chalet du Cycle,
another restaurant with a superb garden flaming
in flowers, and dotted with cozy thatched kiosks
like the huts of some jungle village and dotted
with tables shaded by huge red umbrellas. Here
at the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">apéritif</span></i> hour the crowd comes <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en bicyclette</span></i>
and automobile, and at night the hurrying
waiters serve parties dining cozily in the glow of
shaded candles. The Chalet du Cycle is a
charming place in which to breakfast some sunny
morning with the Seine gliding close by under
the trees.</p>

<p class='c000' >Another segment of fairy-land, even more exquisite
in its <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mise en scène</span></i>, is the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Café de Madrid</span>.
Here a low, rambling, half-timbered house forms
a courtyard which is as brilliant at night with
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haut monde</span></i> at dinner. Here, too, as at Armenonville,
the carriages, entering under a gateway
smothered in trailing vines, drive in past the
tables. Everywhere about you there are flowers—banks
of geraniums and fragrant roses. When
you have dined, you can turn your armchair and
watch the beauty about you and the victorias
coming and going.</p>

<p class='c000' >It is characteristic for Parisians to sit for
hours over dinner. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Café de Madrid</span> at night
resembles closely a garden party given at the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">château</span> of some private estate. It is the absence
of the feeling of publicity that makes it so
charming.</p>

<p class='c000' >And after all this restful luxury there is the
cool <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bois</span> to drive in, through forest alleys with
the smell of the fresh woods all about and the
sparkle of stars overhead.</p>

<p class='c000' >Who will ever tell the history of this famous
playground of rich and poor? How many of its
silent trees have sheltered and kept secret the
romances of the world! How much honor has
been risked for the sake of cruel, triumphant
women whose hearts were tender in proportion
to their needs! And how many real loves have
sought it as a refuge!</p>

<p class='c000' >If all this is sad, turn back in your drive
towards the sparkling lights of the city, to Paris
who is now wearing all her jewels. Some of her
strings of diamonds are glittering through the
vista of black trees ahead—or are these only
the footlights of the great
stage whereon so many comedies,
so many tragedies,
and so many light farces,
have been played?</p>

<p class='c000' >The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Robinière</span> once existed on the first platform
of the Tour Eiffel; since then its proprietor,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur François Robin</span>, has moved it to its
permanent address, all of which speaks well for
its success. It is filled nightly with Parisians of
the vicinity.</p>

<p class='c000' >Much of the success of this tiny theater is due
to the indefatigable effort of its director, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur
Robin</span>, who literally passes his life in his
playhouse, assisted in its management by his
wife. These two, without help, without even a
secretary, run the theater, often working from
early morning until long past midnight, writing
their own posters, watching the rehearsals of
their excellent small company (in which <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame</span>
plays), attending to press notices, receiving
authors and artists, and, in short, making a success
of this old “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle d’Antin</span>” where all its
preceding owners met with ruin.</p>

<p class='c000' >There is nothing elaborate about this stuffy
little bandbox of a theater. Its narrow auditorium
is plain, dingy and old-fashioned. A piano
serves for the orchestra, but the comedies are
clever and the acting excellent—two things
which Parisians demand first of all.</p>

<p class='c000' >The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Robinière</span> is but one of a number of miniature
theaters in Paris beginning at eight-thirty
or nine o’clock, and producing each night
four short realistic comedies, often with some
clever <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansonnier</span></i> singing his creations during the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entr’actes</span></i>. No two of these theaters are alike,
and in all of them there is good acting; even
in the smallest of these so-called <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouis-bouis</span></i>
you will find the actors to be men and women
who have worked patiently through the National
Conservatoire studying their art under the best
masters.</p>

<p class='c000' >Fortunately in France the woman who has
become suddenly notorious through her divorce
or the latest scandal is not snapped up by theatrical
managers as a star before the ink is dry
on the Sunday papers detailing her disgrace. In
Paris there are music hall <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revues</span></i> to receive these
meteors when they fall and where they may
parade their beauty and their clothes, or their
lack of them, with the rest of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-mondaines</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000' >During the intervals between the plays at the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Robinière</span> a single aged “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon de café</span></i>” takes
the orders for the refreshments in the cold,
stuffy little “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fumoir</span></i>,” while behind the bar one
of the leading ladies of the comedy graciously
assists him by opening the bottled beer and attending
to the drinks, very much as a good-natured
woman would help by cutting the cake
at a children’s party.</p>

<p class='c000' >When the bell rings for the curtain <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame</span>
hurries out of her apron and back to her part in
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Deux Jarretières</span>,” a farce so replete with
amusing complications that the small audience
is kept in a continual titter of good humor. In
the comedy following, entitled “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Sofa de
Monsieur Dupré</span>,” the story is even more simple.
A respectable widow, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Dupré</span>, living
alone in her old age, is attended by her maid
Pauline, whom she has come to regard as an
indispensable companion. Pauline makes the
old lady comfortable in her favorite chair, tucks
under her feet her foot-warmer, and, leaving her
mistress, goes out to post a letter.</p>

<p class='c000' >In the interval which elapses before her return
a neighbor calls and kindly informs <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame
Dupré</span> that the indispensable Pauline has been
the mistress of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Dupré</span>’s revered husband.
When Pauline returns, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame</span>, in her
indignation, turns her out of the house. The
foot-warmer grows cold, the fire in the grate
goes out, a thousand little comforts have not
been attended to, and the old lady decides to
send for Pauline and forgive her, preferring that
her few remaining years should pass in peace
and comfort.</p>

<p class='c000' >Quite different is the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre de la Bodinière</span>,
founded by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Bodin</span>, the former secretary
of the historic <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comédie Française</span>. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bodinière</span>
is devoted to interpreting the work of young
authors by celebrated artists. It is a theater
where respectable <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeunes filles</span></i> may be taken in
safety. The plays are as harmless as the Rollo
books.</p>

<p class='c000' >The playwright, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aimé Ducrocq</span>, is the founder
and manager of a cozy blue-and-gold <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonbonnière</span>
of a theater called the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rabelais</span>,” in
Montmartre. Here, as the title suggests, the
comedies and farces are thoroughly Rabelaisian.
It might even be averred that they are more so
than elsewhere, which is saying a great deal.
Here farces like “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Vertu De Nini</span>,” “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La
Journée d’une Demi-Mondaine</span>” and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Corset
de Germaine</span>” pack the small auditorium nightly.
Many of these are written to a point where the
curtain discreetly drops upon the situation, but
none of them harbors a line or a gesture of vulgarity.
It is not worth while having trouble
with the police, and happily the French policeman
is both broad-minded and discreet in enforcing
an arbitrary rule. When you ask a policeman
here why a thing is prohibited he will shrug
his shoulders, stare at you in astonishment, and
reply brusquely: “It is prohibited because it is
prohibited!”</p>

<p class='c000' >Which settles all further argument.</p>

<p class='c000' >There are but two things which I find absolutely
interdicted: malicious satires against the
Government, and breaking the Parisian peace.
The rest, which has merely to do with
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’Amour</span>,” seems to the policemen not worth
bothering their heads about.</p>

<p class='c000' >A “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">’Cipal</span></i>” (municipal guard) is detailed during
a performance of any kind in Paris in every theater,
music-hall or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabaret</span></i>, to jot down in a small
black-covered book anything which may offend
his sense of delicacy, but he is generally too
hugely amused in watching the stage to do so.
During moments like these his ruddy visage,
with its bristly mustache, at other times so stern,
is wreathed in wrinkles of delight, and his formidable
short sword sleeps peacefully in its
scabbard. These are the lighter hours of his
existence; where he is needed you will find him
brave as a bulldog and quick as a cat, and intelligent
and honest as well. You cannot bribe a
French policeman.</p>

<p class='c000' >The one who generously offered me half his
seat at a crowded performance the other night
poured forth his opinions <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sotto voce</span></i> during the
second act of a risqué comedy. He was sincere
and enthusiastic in his praise of our President
and struck his brass-buttoned chest as he pronounced
him a good man and a brave soldier;
however, I regret that some of his views of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La
Fayette</span> are unfit for publication, as he regarded
him as a traitor to France.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, monsieur</span></i>,” he said, savagely; “a man
who gave his strength and knowledge and power
to another country when that man belonged to
our army was a traitor.” He said other things,
too, about the gentleman, but they will not bear
a graceful translation.</p>

<p class='c000' >Below the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rabelais</span>, past an iron grill and at
the end of a cobbled court in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue Chaptal</span>, is
the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grand Guignol</span>.” Its oak interior in carved
Gothic was once the studio of the celebrated
painter, Rochegrosse, and resembles at first
glance, except for the boxes running beneath
the low choir gallery, the lecture room of a
modern Episcopal church. The prevailing tone
of the room, gray corduroy and oak, is thoroughly
restful. From the spandrelled ceiling hang iron
chandeliers of ecclesiastical design. A paneled
frieze of allegorical paintings, representing the
human passions—envy, hate and jealousy—enrich
the cove. Carved angels support the corbels
of the ceiling beams, and a square of rare
Gobelins tapestry enriches the wall back of the
gallery. A simple proscenium, in keeping with
the rest of this exquisite interior, fills the end of
the room.</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c000' >There is a small foyer, too, with a Gothic
stairway, which contains a unique collection of
steel engravings of players of bygone days.
Snug in an alcove beside this interesting <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">promenoir</span></i>
there is a tiny bar. At nine the boxes beneath
the Sunday-school gallery are brilliant with
women’s toilets, framed by the white shirt-fronts
and sombre black of their well-groomed escorts.
Such is this charming after-dinner theater, which
has been so appropriately named “The Big
Punch and Judy,” where very cleverly constructed
short plays are presented, such as
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Scrupules</span>,” “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Une Affaire de Mœurs</span>,” “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La
Coopérative</span>” and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Fétiche</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000' >They are plays of dramatic incident rather
than of plots. Some of them are as risqué as
the most daring at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rabelais</span>. Some are full
of pathos, others screamingly funny, and still
others revolting in their realism.</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c000' >Of the last class is “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Une Affaire de Mœurs</span>.”
In this the identity of a famous judge of the high
court is discovered by two <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-mondaines</span></i> who
are dining with him in a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabinet particulier</span></i>. The
judge has at one time sentenced the lover of one
of the women and she threatens to expose him
in revenge. He offers money, and finally half
his fortune to quiet her, but the woman is determined
to avenge her lover. Then his terror at
the thought of scandal and disgrace brings on a
stroke of apoplexy. The two women, now thoroughly
frightened, send the old waiter out for a
doctor. He hurries back with a young physician
whom he finds carousing with his friends in the
café below. The young man stands aghast as
he recognizes the form in the chair; it is his
father. He listens at the heart, then buries his
head in his hands. The judge is dead. The
women huddle in a corner terrified. The room
is in disorder, reeking with the odor of cigarettes
and spilled wine.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Come, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>,” gently urges the aged
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</span>. “Pull yourself together, we must get
the body into a cab unnoticed.”</p>

<p class='c000' >The realization of the disgrace and publicity
of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">affaire</span></i> when it will be known in the café
below, braces the son to act quickly. He suggests
to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</span> that the body be removed by
the back stairs.</p>

<p class='c000' >“There is no back stairs, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>,” confesses
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</span>. “The only way out is by the main
stairway and through the café. We will walk
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span> out and support him between us. I
have helped to do it once before that way; no
one will suspect—they will think <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span> is
drunk.”</p>

<p class='c000' >Together they put on the Inverness and,
adjusting the opera hat of the deceased and
supporting the body beneath the arms, walk
slowly with it to the door leading to the stairs,
the two women preceding them, singing hysterically
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marche des pompiers</span></i>!</p>

<p class='c000' >As the curtain fell the audience seemed in a
stupor. A woman beside me sat staring at the
floor, crying. Men coughed and remained silent.
Not until the pianist in the foyer struck up a
lively polka did they leave their seats for a little
cognac and a breath of air.</p>

<p class='c000' >Just such realism is typical of the Grand
Guignol.</p>

<p class='c000' >Even smaller than the Grand Guignol is the
cozy “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre des Mathurins</span>,” with a pretty
foyer twice the size of its small auditorium,
which scarcely holds two hundred.</p>

<p class='c000' >Here short plays like “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Camille</span>,”
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Quadrille</span>” and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Deux Courtisanes</span>”
are played with rare finish by De Marcy, Cora
Lapercerie, and other famous beauties of the
Parisian stage.</p>

<p class='c000' >During the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entr’actes</span></i> a shutter over an archway
of the foyer opens and the head of a celebrated
singing satirist is thrust out from the
dark closet like the punctual cuckoo in the clock.
During the intermission he sings his original
songs to the listening throng, a mixture of the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand-</span></i> and the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-monde</span></i> promenading below.</p>

<p class='c000' >Most diminutive of them all is the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre
des Capucines</span>,” whose auditorium is no larger
than a private salon. This <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">intime</span></i> playhouse is
frequented by the most exclusive audience to be
found in Paris. Before the curtain rises it resembles
a drawing-room filled with a society
gathering for amateur theatricals. The walls of
yellow brocade, with a delicate decoration of
nasturtiums, gives it even more the air of a private
drawing-room, and the tiny stage seems to have
been erected for the occasion. Only when the
curtain rises is the illusion dispelled, for at the
Capucines the short comedies are rendered by
many of the most celebrated players of the
French stage.</p>

<p class='c000' >Here the great Gémier plays “Daisy,” in which
his portrayal of a race-track thief, jealous over
his sweetheart Léa (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle Carlier</span>), is a
masterpiece of character acting.</p>

<p class='c000' >Other little comedies, like “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au Temps des
Croisées</span>,” by Guy de Maupassant, with Gallo in
the principal rôle, and Viviane Lavergne and
Max Dearly in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chonchette</span>,” with charming
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Thérèse Berka</span>, leave little to wonder that the
tiny <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre des Capucines</span> is crowded nightly
with the most intelligent of Parisian society.</p>

<p class='c000' >I found my old friend the Baron after the play
at Pousset’s beginning his midnight supper of
“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écrevisses</span></i>” and beer, alone and in a grumbling
mood.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah! Ah! tant mieux!</span></i> It is you, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon ami</span></i>,” he
cried. “Good, we shall have supper together.
It is fortunate that I find you. Do you know,”
he continued, motioning me to a seat beside
him, “I have this evening been to such a bad
play, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Diable!</span></i> It is a relief to get here. To
rinse the eyes, as we say, from such a gloomy
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">histoire</span></i>! One goes to the theater to laugh, is it
not, eh? Not to have what you call him—zee,
zee blues.</p>

<p class='c000' >“For three hours, my friend,” he continued,
frowning at the memory of it, “for three hours,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">imaginez-vous</span></i>, I have been following a lot of unhappy
people into the horrors of Siberia. Those
who survived until the last act were finally put
to death or separated brutally from those dear
to them. Many of them were blind. The heroine
was forced to betray her lover, who was finally
led to execution before her eyes. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sapristi!</span></i>” and
the Baron pounded his great fist on the table.
Then, choking with laughter over the humorous
side of it so that he dropped his monocle, he
continued:</p>

<p class='c000' >“It is to this I go to be amused, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon Dieu</span></i>! I
would rathzair be at a funeral!”</p>

<p class='c000' >Here the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</span> interrupted us with the
cognac.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Tell me, Baron,” I said, as we lighted our
cigars, “what, in your opinion, has made the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouis-bouis</span></i> become so popular with you Parisians?
I have just come from the Capucines. It
was not gloomy there, I assure you; the little
house was as gay as a tulip patch and bubbling
over with merriment.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“Listen,” replied the Baron, putting his forefinger
to his forehead impressively. “The success
of the little theaters with short plays
comes from the fact that nowadays a crisis has
been reached in theatrical affairs. The public,
as it is after all for them that plays are given,
have put the author at his wits’ end to invent
something new. The old actors who are too
sure of themselves have become careless, and
the young ones, in trying to create a personal
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">genre</span></i>, end in attaining a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pose</span></i> which, through
its affectation, is always lacking in art.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Then there are the critics, who are always
watching for ‘the little beast,’ as we say, and
who seem to discover only elephantine faults,
and finally there are the directors of the theaters,
who are constantly torn between their desire
to please the public, satisfy the actor, protect
art, and fill their purses.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“It is different with us,” I replied; “we have
syndicates in charge of our amusements. The
personal desires of the players are not considered,
and the managerial head of the enterprise rarely
knows or cares about art.</p>

<p class='c000' >“It is purely a business with him, like the running
of a series of big dry-goods stores, and so
he hustles out on the road his companies number
one, two and three, and sits twirling his
thumbs in his office computing how much cash
they will bring him back.</p>

<p class='c000' >“And what were the conditions which brought
this crisis you speak of?” I asked, returning to
the main subject.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Ah, then you have not heard,” he replied,
“of the investigation made by Messieurs Allard
and Vauxelles, who addressed themselves to
the directors of the principal theaters: Messieurs
Porel, Claretie, Antoine, <i>et al.</i>, and to authors
like Brieux and Hervieu. They explained
clearly where the trouble lies. In the first place,
it is a fact that the growing popularity of outdoor
sports in France constitutes a real danger
for the theater. The love of physical exercise,
of bicycling, automobiling, of field sports and
ballooning, increases daily with us.</p>

<p class='c000' >“It is excellent for the muscles, but when one
has steered one’s “tuff-tuff” all day or been
driven through the clouds in a balloon, the tired
sportsman is in no condition nor frame of mind to
enjoy in the evening a serious play. Is it not so?
It is imbecile to expect it of him.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Notice,” he went on, “that I am speaking of
the Frenchman upon whom physical exercise
has more effect than on the Anglo-Saxon who
has been accustomed to it from his youth. With
our impetuosity we overdo things. Besides,
the athlete is not a good spectator, for what is
won for the biceps is lost for the brain.</p>

<p class='c000' >“What our good man of the world returning
from a hard day’s sport must have, is either his
bed, or a light, gay <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i> with perfect brain rest
during it. So he dines late and goes to the
circus, or to the performance of a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i>, or to one
of the small theaters, or to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouis-bouis</span></i>, where
the lightest of farce comedies sends him home in
a good humor. These latter miniature theaters
have become so popular with us that nearly
every <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quartier</span></i> now has its <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouis-bouis</span></i>. They have
sprung up like weeds and steal an important
part of the audience of the serious theaters.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>A POPULAR STAR OF A REVUE</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c000' >“Then, too, the modern comforts we find in
our restaurants and other public places are lacking
in our playhouses, whose interiors have remained
unchanged for more than half a century,
and where one is badly seated or stifled in a
stuffy box. Again, the theater proper, once the
most moderate-priced of amusements, has become
with us so expensive that most bourgeois
families or the average Parisian cannot afford
to go.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Besides, in the serious theaters the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entr’actes</span></i>
have become interminably long, the acts ridiculously
short. We begin to have enough, too,
of what we term <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pornographie</span></i>; of plays full of
salacious intrigue and of moral degeneracy,
which most of our young authors seem to revel
in, and which they call ‘a slice of life (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une tranche
de vie</span></i>).’” He added earnestly:</p>

<p class='c000' >“The Parisian wants gay plays, clever vaudeville,
or little comedies full of sparkling wit and
humorous situations. The Parisian wants it all
the more because the stage lately has been too
much under the influence of foreigners like Ibsen,
Sudermann, Hauptmann, Tolstoy and the rest.”
And the Baron added, with a wink:</p>

<p>THE SETTING OF A SOCIETY PLAY</p>

</div>

<p class='c000' >“It is, after all, an eternal exchange. They
have taken from us what we have taken from
them. The Romantic school has nourished
them, Georges Sand has deeply influenced Russian
literature. The type of the Ibsenian woman
is Georges Sand’s ‘Lélia’; even the last play of
Dumas, that ‘Route de Thèbes,’ shows the influence
of Ibsen. Dumas imitated Ibsen, but remained
himself. These foreign writers are the
sons of our French <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">romantiques</span></i>, who themselves
were the sons of Schiller and Goethe, just as
they in turn were the sons of the eighteenth
century and were descended from Diderot and
the Encyclopedists.</p>

<p class='c000' >“But the public revolts against all this modern
pessimism,” continued my friend—“against <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur
Hervieu</span>, for example, because he tries to
prove in his plays that the stage of to-day is less
pessimistic than of old. But he can say all he
wishes,” affirmed the Baron, warmly, “and the
dramatic world may insist that it used to be even
sadder, that the old playwrights made people
die, that Camille was dead! that the ‘Femme
de Claude’ was dead! that the theaters in bygone
days were sumptuous slaughter-houses,
becoming veritable battle-fields by the fifth act,
as in ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Étrangère</span>,’ ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Princesse George</span>,’ and
so many others. But what do you want?” the
Baron went on. “The public like it better, for
when the people in the play are killed off once
and for all, the good spectator has no more
to worry over.” And the Baron pushed aside
his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écrevisses</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Everything is settled! nothing to think
about,” he continued. “What fault then do
the public find in the modern plays? It is not
that they finish badly, but that they do not
finish at all!</p>

<p class='c000' >“The ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</span>’! Ah! There is a word,”
cried the Baron, “that has the gift of exasperating
all our young authors. They cannot
resign themselves like Augier, Dumas and
Sardou, to see on the stroke of midnight the
hero marry the heroine and virtue get its
reward.</p>

<p class='c000' >“All this is to them old-fashioned. The dénouement
of Denise makes them smile, and
Francillon, whose heroine hasn’t really deceived
her husband, seems to them a farce. So, to
finish in a newer way, they do not finish at all.
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voilà!</span></i> It is simpler, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hein!</span></i> but confess that it
isn’t any more difficult!</p>

<p class='c000' >“It is this which depresses the bourgeois,
who has come to the theater to amuse himself.
He comes out at the end of the play
with one more worry on his conscience. He
leaves pensive and saddened and oppressed by
the gloominess of it all.</p>

<p class='c000' >“In ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Envers d’une Sainte</span>,’ <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">François de
Curel</span> sends his heroine back to her convent,
and Henry Becque ends ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Corbeaux</span>’ by a
marriage which makes you foresee a loveless
life of misery and oppression. And the proof
of the growing distaste for these sad plays is,
that when they played ‘Ties’ at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Français</span>
lately, they felt obliged to give at the end a
little play in one act full of gaiety, so as to dry
the eyelids and expand the chest of all those
who were going to bed.”</p>

<p class='c000' >The hour had grown late, the café was deserted,
and the Baron’s <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écrevisses</span></i> had become
cold. Outside two nighthawk cabs stood waiting
for a chance trip. Fog rose from the slime
of the boulevard.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Come and dine with me to-morrow night at
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Café Anglais</span>,” said the Baron, as he tucked
up the collar of his coat and entered his cab,
“and we will go up to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rabelais</span> and see
‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Corset de Germaine</span>.’”</p>

<p class='c000' >You must not judge the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre du Châtelet</span> by
the melodramas which accompany the gorgeous
spectacles given there; where the ballets are
superb and the arts of scenic painting and stage
mechanism are seen in their perfection.</p>

<p>AFTER THE THEATER</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >The melodrama I saw at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Châtelet</span> concurrent
with the spectacle in twelve acts and twenty
tableaux, was written especially for the chief
actor. The hero finds himself, as the curtain
rises, in the interior of India, where he soon falls
in love with a beautiful princess, Zuléma by
name, the only daughter of a rich sheik.</p>

<p class='c000' >It is love at first sight with Zuléma and the
hero, and, before the orchestra had played
through a dozen bars, the lovers make hasty
plans for an elopement, taking with them
Zuléma’s faithful maid.</p>

<p class='c000' >The flight of the happy pair is fraught from
that time on with an exciting series of hairbreadth
escapes, but these little incidents do not
seem to trouble the hero, he being constantly
occupied with his personal appearance.</p>

<p class='c000' >In the second act the hero led the princess,
still in the jeweled tea-gown she wore when
they met, up to the last barricade of an elaborately
carved oriental city, which is besieged
by the English.</p>

<p class='c000' >Here the hero bids the princess and her maid
sit down while he rolls a cigarette, and incidentally
picks off with his gun, rested on the sill of a
convenient window, the leaders of the advancing
army.</p>

<p>FINALE AT THE THÉÂTRE PORTE ST. MARTIN</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >During all this fighting his gray leather leggings
remain as spotless as the flowing silk
scarf heaving over his manly chest, sunburned
by adventure. All of which win for him not
only the heart of the beautiful Zuléma, but of
every other fellow’s sweetheart throughout the
depth and breadth of the broad gallery.</p>

<p class='c000' >At last the trio reach a ravine. As yet none
of the princess’s jewels have been stolen; she
still wears the décolleté tea-gown and keeps her
manicured nails well polished. In the ravine,
behind a papier-maché rock, Zuléma discovers
her irate father, who, having been hot-footed up
hill and down dale by the bloodthirsty <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Anglais</span></i>,
is glad enough to come out of his hiding place to
give his blessing to the eloping pair, and bestow
upon the powdered neck of his only child a talisman—whereupon
our hero pounds his chest and
swears to revenge their pursuers.</p>

<p class='c000' >An old friend of mine who knows Fourteenth
street better than I do tells me that most of the
spirit mediums who rent a residence along it
during the season when Coney Island is frozen
over, never call upon a lesser personage for a
spirit answer than Napoléon Bonaparte! For
who would pay two dollars to hear Uncle John’s
opinion of his only living relative? It is surprising
that the great Napoléon should make a beeline
for Fourteenth street before even going to
wash up at the club. But he does. “Ting-a-ling-a-ling,”
goes the bell, and the head of the
First Empire tells from behind a turkey-red curtain
all he knows as precisely as a museum
dwarf does his age. And so it is with our hero
when he stumbles across a witch in the ravine,
who happens to be occupied at the time in boiling
a purée of certain poisonous herbs. She
gives him a morsel of her stew, which he straightway
puts in his upper pocket, and becomes as
invulnerable against the bullets of the popping
enemy as a Sandy Hook target in front of a popgun.
They fairly rattle off him. The princess
thinks it nothing short of Providence, and says
so. She and her serving-maid occupy themselves
with their fancy work at the bottom of the secret
fastness while our hero with the magnetic eye
peers over an adjoining rock, and the father of
the fair Zuléma up stage keeps sharp watch of
the enemy from beneath the folds of his voluminous
cloak.</p>

<p class='c000' >And so the day passes and night comes on
apace and the stars glitter in pairs in the canvas
heavens. No sound breaks the stillness of the
night save the creepy titter of violins in the
orchestra.</p>

<p class='c000' >Now the ravine goes black as a solio print in
the sun, and then pales to violet. The ballet
has begun. In swinging rhythm a hundred
shapely <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coryphées</span></i> glide and pirouette towards the
footlights, withdrawing among the pillars of a
golden temple to give place to a hundred others
advancing.</p>

<p class='c000' >These ballet girls are French and can dance.</p>

<p class='c000' >Calcium lights sizzle and hiss from the gallery
and from the upper boxes. Simultaneously,
their violet screens change with a click to azure,
now to gold. Carmanillo, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">première danseuse</span></i>, is
whirling in a circle as Amardi taught her to do
so well years ago in Milan. When Carmanillo
dances she scarcely seems to touch the stage,
but when she walks on the flat of her feet, as all
ballet women do, she has the awkward gait of
an acrobat.</p>

<p class='c000' >A veil midway down the vast stage lifts, disclosing
an oriental city. A cortège of slaves advances,
followed by another line of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coryphées</span></i>.
Behind this barrier of grace and color, come the
retinue of a barbaric court, gorgeously costumed,
and headed by white Arabian horses,
caparisoned in turquoise and gold. The favorite
of the Sultan is borne past, reclining on a
crimson velvet litter.</p>

<p class='c000' >A second veil lifts, disclosing in the hazy distance
the limits of the city; spires, domes and
minarets are bathed in a glow of golden light.
The depth of the great stage has been reached,
and in reality it is nearly the length of a Parisian
block. Upon the topmost pinnacle of this
apotheosis of color stands a woman, nude, her
hair glittering in jewels.</p>

<p class='c000' >In the royal box before which the cortège has
passed rests the hero for whom the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span> has been
given. He is still in his spotless leggings. He
accepts the homage of the conquered city condescendingly.
With him it is a nightly matter
of fact. The fair Zuléma is by his side. Her
maid has had time to don a Paris hat, but
Zuléma clings to her tea-gown and gazes in
adoration at the hero. A delicious waltz swells
up from the orchestra. The stage is swarming
now with whirling, kicking <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coryphées</span></i>; more
horses clatter in over planking, followed by more
swaying palanquins; the scene resembles a
kaleidoscope of ever changing color, costume
and light.</p>

<p class='c000' >Trumpets blaze from the ramparts of the city,
a red fire burns in the wings, and down comes
the curtain.</p>

<p class='c000' >Such is the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Châtelet</span>.</p>

<p class='c000' >As a spectacle it is as perfect as the best
choreographic brains can make it.</p>

<p class='c000' >Half an hour later, in a nearby café, I came
across the hero and Zuléma slaking a tropical
thirst with two tall steins of beer. The beautiful
princess carried her stage shoes with her,
wrapped in a newspaper. Presently I caught
sight of the faithful maid hurrying to a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabinet
particulier</span></i> upstairs with a gentleman in a silk hat
and a fur-lined overcoat. I afterwards learned
that the maid and Zuléma did not speak.</p>

There was a certain coziness
about the “Bar du Grillon.”
It was well named, this “Bar
of the Cricket,” for, tho a
public resort, it was thoroughly
homelike.</p>

<p class='c000' >The walls of the tiny room
were of polished cherry, and
masses of Jacqueminot roses
adorned the bar.</p>

<p class='c000' >Every day its charming
proprietress, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Lucille
de Bréville</span>, stepped from her
brougham, passed through the screen doorway,
deposited the contents of the money-drawer in
her golden purse, made a memorandum of it with
a little turquoise-topped pencil which hung from
her châtelaine, gave an extra touch to her wavy
hair in a tiny mirror, and straightway became the
most gracious of hostesses to a dozen old friends
who dropped in during the afternoon and dined
at eight.</p>

<p class='c000' >A pretty woman is difficult to describe, but
Lucille de Bréville was more than pretty; she
was beautiful, exasperatingly so. It might have
been the curve of her white throat, or the merriness
in the depths of her violet eyes, or the
grace of her matured and exquisite figure which
gave her charm, for Lucille possessed all these.
Better still, she had a heart of gold and a clever
brain, both of which won for her many comrades
who were too fond of her to make love to her.
Lucille had had many love affairs. That was
one reason why she became at thirty quite a
serious proprietress of the Bar du Grillon. The
pin money which it brought her gave her an interest
in life, for most French women seem to
inherit a little of the bourgeois blood of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">commerçants</span></i>.
With her pin money she could do as
she pleased; with her annuity it was different.
There was always an accounting accompanying
that. At thirty, Lucille had sold most of her
jewels and with the proceeds founded a private
charity, and had settled upon a frail old aunt
who adored her a yearly amount sufficient to
keep her in modest comfort to the end of her
days.</p>

<p class='c000' >Individually the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitués</span> of the Bar du Grillon
were interesting.</p>

<p class='c000' >There was an aged Countess who came regularly,
an amiable old lady, shriveled like a faded
rose, the memoirs of whose sixty years would
have filled a volume.</p>

<p class='c000' >There was, too, a robust and jolly editor of a
leading journal, a most polished gentleman of
France, with a well-trimmed beard framing a
countenance beaming with good humor.</p>

<p class='c000' >Thirdly, there was the Count de X——, who
spent most of his time before and after dinner in
the only rocking-chair in the place, with Lucille’s
two sleek-coated dachshunds curled contentedly
in his lap.</p>

<p class='c000' >Sometimes, on sunny days, the Count went to
the races and with absent mind watched the
horses win or lose for him. Upon days like
these he would return to the bar late to find the
rocking-chair occupied, and this is why he did
not go to the track oftener. But whether he
lost or won, whichever way the wheel of fortune
spun for him, his outward manner preserved its
even tenor. He was ever polished and agreeable.
To him life had no new sensations, and he
took it philosophically and with good grace.
Perhaps the sole interest which he cherished
was his deep affection for Lucille, but since many
others among her old friends harbored the same
feeling, to which she responded with the most
exasperating of platonic friendships, the Count
accepted the situation logically and retired to
the rocking-chair to talk to the dachshunds.</p>

<p class='c000' >The young Spaniard who sat at Lucille’s left
at dinner accepted the situation less wisely.
Often he burst forth beneath his breath with
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Caramba!</span></i> and other safety-valves of speech.
Periodically he became desperate, and, since he
could not lay his castles in Spain at her feet, he
brooded over the thought of suicide, and would
absent himself from the company for days,
drinking heavily. Then he would return to the
Grillon with the excuse that he had been at
death’s door in his apartment. Tho he looked
it, Lucille knew better and lectured him for
his recklessness and especially for his intemperate
habits, which she abhorred.</p>

<p class='c000' >Another <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitué</span> was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle Marcelle
Dauval</span>, who fell in love with an aeronaut and
spent most of her time in balloons. When
Marcelle was late for dinner the company wore
an anxious air, took out their watches, poked
their heads out of the door and surveyed the
heavens through the slit of the narrow street.
Often, as the dinner hour approached, the
sky was black and full of scudding clouds,
and the dinner would begin without her in
silence born of anxiety. Then what joy when
Marcelle arrived, her cheeks glowing from a
rarer atmosphere than any of these sordid worldlings
knew! “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pâté de foie gras</span></i>, cold pheasant
and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">champagne brut</span></i> at a height of two thousand
meters! Eh, Hop!” and Marcelle gave a little
scream at the memory of it. Often she navigated
the big balloon herself, throwing out the
sand and sprinkling the “Germans,” as she
used to say, as they glided on long trips over a
patch of the Fatherland. Or she would curl
herself up in the creaky basket while her companion
Jacques busied himself with his aerial
observations.</p>

<p class='c000' >The company would listen entranced to these
recitals of the trim Marcelle’s daily experiences,
and marvel at her fearlessness.</p>

<p class='c000' >There was another genial comrade, Jeannette
Brébant, whose forty odd years had left her
frank, mannish and homely. There was no
feminine pettishness to be found in Jeannette.
She called a spade a spade, and dealt you whole
shovelfuls of badinage, shook hands like a man
and had a kind word for every one, even her old
lovers. A well-groomed woman was Jeannette,
with her Titian hair as neatly dressed at four
o’clock as the smartest coiffeur in Paris could
make it.</p>

<p class='c000' >At eight, the faithful Louis, whose position as
barkeeper and waiter made him indispensable,
placed a Japanese screen in front of the door as
a hint to warn intruders, pushed the three small
tables together and laid the fresh cloth for
dinner, bringing the vases of roses which had
adorned the bar to the table. Lucille loved flowers,
and a basketful of long-stemmed Jacqueminots
came daily from the hot-house of her
pretty place at Étretat, where Lucille rested
during the hottest of the summer months when
every Parisian who was able fled from the city.</p>

<p class='c000' >Then Lucille closed the bar for its annual
renovation and the faithful Louis was sent on
a vacation to his family on the German frontier,
where he rested from his cocktail-mixing and
studied English, which he rarely had occasion
to use and which was quite as bad as his
French. The only thing American about this
“American Bar” was the sign over the door,
beneath which appeared a long list of American
drinks with weird names, translated to him from
a bartender’s guide published on the Bowery in
the early sixties, not one concoction of which he
had ever been able to mix.</p>

<p class='c000' >During the summer period workmen invaded
the Grillon and a general varnishing took place.
The small tables were repolished and the chimney
leading from the tiny kitchen cleaned. The
piano was tuned and the cozy interior made
spick and span for the grand opening in the fall.
Then all of the old crowd would return; it was
like the reunion of a family: Jeannette and Marcelle
and the editor and the Count, from his villa
by the sea, and the Spaniard, who never left
Paris. Then such a dinner! So much had happened
in the meantime, and there was so much
to talk about. The Countess had been a month
at Trouville.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah! mes chers enfants</span></i>,” she would begin in
her gentle voice, “It was not like the old days
there any more. Such a common lot about the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits chevaux</span></i>; none of the great toilettes I used
to see, nor as many louis won and lost, either,”
she added, nodding her head.</p>

<p class='c000' >“I played my small purse cautiously on the
‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bande</span></i>’ one day. I won a thousand francs,
and the next morning I took my little <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne
Thérèse</span> south; she is not very strong and she
was so happy to see her mother.”</p>

<p class='c000' >The editor rose and bowed.</p>

<p class='c000' >“You have a good heart, old friend,” he
said, as he bent and kissed the tips of her
fingers.</p>

<p class='c000' >“We stayed there a week on their farm,” continued
the Countess, “and I spent all day in the
sun watching the pigs and the chickens. You
have no idea what an appetite I had and what a
rest in my old clothes.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“Come, come, all of you, my children,” cried
Lucille, “my soup is getting cold;” and she
buried the silver ladle in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">purée</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000' >For some moments after the company were
served they remained silent. The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">purée</span></i> deserved
a prayer of thanks, while Marie, Lucille’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne</span>,
beamed at their satisfaction from the doorway of
her kitchen.</p>

<p class='c000' >“It is good, is it not?” laughed Lucille, delighted
as a child over the new soup.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voilà!</span></i> That is a soup,” roared the editor.</p>

<p class='c000' >“My dear child,” put in the Count, bowing to
Lucille, “I have known intimately for years the
best <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">purées</span></i> of the Maison Dorée; those were
soups. This is a masterpiece! a dream!! a soup
to comfort the soul!!!”</p>

<p class='c000' >“Ah! you dear old boy,” cried Lucille, patting
him on the cheek, “you are always so appreciative;”
and she added, in a whisper, to the rest:
“Marie is enchanted.”</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic013'>
<img src='images/i_117.jpg' alt='' class='ig013' />
<p>IN A BOULEVARD CAFÉ</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >Over the coffee and liqueur they often discussed
in open debate such serious topics as whether or
not marriage was a failure; the finer points of
fidelity; were women more faithful in their love
than men? had luxury become a necessity?
what really constitutes happiness in life; were it
not better to enjoy the present, since one could
not help the past or control the future? etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c000' >Such discussions as these would last until the
hour grew late and the hands of the clock ticking
over the bar crawled to another day.</p>

<p class='c000' >Then the shutters were put up, the company
dispersed, and Lucille’s waiting brougham would
drive her home.</p>

<p class='c000' >But it was the Count who saw her safely
within her carriage, stowed the sleepy dachshunds
in their warm corner under the seat, and
raised his hat as Lucille drove away.</p>

<p class='c012' >Some years have passed since the old days
when “The Bar of the Cricket” held such comrades
as these.</p>

<p class='c000' >It was winter when I turned down the narrow
street again one afternoon and entered the door.</p>

<p class='c000' >The room was silent. The cozy interior had
remained much the same as it had been in the
past; the walls of polished cherry, the tables, the
piano, were in their places as of old, but the
roses on the bar were artificial, and a self-feeding
stove roared in one corner.</p>

<p class='c000' >The faithful Louis came to greet me. He
looked haggard and grayer; the only other occupant
of the room, a man with a hard jaw and a
diamond ring, lounged in the rocking-chair,
muttering to himself over a cocktail.</p>

<p class='c000' >A glance at Louis told me all.</p>

<p class='c000' >“And so they have all gone?” I said.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Yes, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>;” he paused, and his eyes
filled.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Ah! it is not no more now like old days, is
it?” he continued, forcing a smile, and his hand
trembled, clutching his napkin. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de
Bréville</span>, you know, she sold the bar? Yes,
she has gone avay. I hafn’t seen her once,”
and he looked up sadly.</p>

<p class='c000' >“And <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle Marcelle</span>, she is no longer
in Paris; she vent avay now three years to St.
Petersburg,” he continued.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Once I seen de Countess. She come back to
see me. Poor Countess, she is sick—sick like
one dead—so pale, so white, yust like dot napkin.
And now she lives mit <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Brébant</span>.

to a fine lady with plenty money.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“And the editor?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000' >“I don’t see him no more; he vas a goot man;”
and he added, softly, lowering his voice, “I tink
he vas in love mit <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Bréville</span>! Ya, I
tink so.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“Have you heard from the Count?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Ah! you don’t hear about him, no? He was
suicided. He vent and shooted hisself. It vas
in all de papers. He vas a fine gentleman, too,
de Count. And so, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>, it is only Louis
who stays; may be I be better off if I do, vhat
you tink? May be it vill be a goot place again
some day?”</p>

<p class='c012' >In the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bois</span> one sunny morning a little girl in
a velvet dress came running to me as fast as her
chubby legs could carry her and screaming:
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>, my mamma wishes to
speak to you; she is just over there in the carriage,”
and she pointed with a majestic sweep
of her little hand to a landau waiting under the
shade of the acacias.</p>

<p class='c000' >It was Lucille, happily married to one none of
us had ever seen.</p>

<p class='c000' >There are many bars in Paris with barmaids
who speak perfect English and a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clientèle</span> of
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-mondaines</span></i> who do not.</p>

<div class='imgright c014'   >
 <img src='images/i_121.jpg' alt='' class='c015' />
</div>

<p class='c000' >Many of these places have grown to be miniature
Maximes and quite a few of them keep a
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chasseur</span></i> in gilt buttons. They are frequented by
the idling <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeunesse</span></i> with more “louis” than
brains, who occupy late in the afternoon the high
stools and pay accordingly for the flattering
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bons mots</span></i> of certain powdered and bediamonded
ladies who in years are old enough to be their
grandmothers. The
fortunes of the callow
youths tumble
eventually either
into the hands of
these well-seasoned
adventuresses or
into the pocket of
the card-sharps who
patronize many of
these bars. Beside
these there are
many eminently respectable
looking old gentlemen who, with unhappy
homes and no clubs to go to, prefer
passing a restful hour steeped in an atmosphere
of mixed drinks, perfume and expensive toilettes.
Here <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mimi la Duchesse</span> strolls in at five o’clock
with her French bulldog, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mignon</span>,” wearing all
the diamonds around his neck that the fair Mimi
has not room for on her fingers. Later in the
winter, when creditors are pressing and Mimi’s
debts have run into several hundred thousands of
francs, there will be a very <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chic</span></i> catalog issued announcing
an absolute auction of her effects, together
with her private hotel.</p>

<p class='c000' >It will contain several full-page photogravures
upon hand-made deckle-edged paper of her residence,
with a frontispiece showing the interior
of the “Great Hall” paneled in Spanish leather,
its fireplace taken from a famous <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">château</span> of the
time of François I., and hanging over the carved
shelf a celebrated Madonna, under whose sad
eyes have been played nightly so many heavy
games of baccarat. Turning another page you
will discover the view looking south through the
conservatory filled with rare exotic plants and
orchids. Another page shows the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</span></i>, rich in
carved ivory and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cloisonne</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">art nouveau</span></i>, none
of which Mimi knew anything about except that
they were expensive and that many of them
accompanied the bonbons. Then the dainty
boudoir is depicted, paneled in teakwood and
lapis-lazuli. Finally her superb jewels are illustrated:
priceless strings of pearls; rings of
weighty emeralds and pigeon-blood rubies; a
gold toilet-set studded with sapphires; and
something to adorn Mimi’s neck, composed
mostly of diamonds, with a miniature automobile
in rubies, pendent from a display of jeweled
fruits upheld by two caryatids in diamonds and
emeralds. Besides all these, are three ruby
collars that Mignon as yet had never worn.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>MIMI QUESTIONS THE BARON</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c000' >With the publication of this <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">catalogue de luxe</span></i>,
rumors reach the ears of the public of the lady’s
dire distress, and the pathetic side of this forced
sale will be dwelt upon. At the private view her
residence is crowded with the curious of the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand monde</span></i>. These women of the most exclusive
society cross her threshold and block her stairway
and pry into every open corner of her domicile—women
who would have been shocked to
find themselves in front of her doorstep at any
other time. So much for the moral hypocrisy
of the virtuous.</p>

<p class='c000' >And while the stairways at this private view
are thronged with the fashionable world, Mimi
and her most intimate friends are laughing over
champagne and biscuits in the kitchen, the only
room that has not been turned over to the public.</p>

<p class='c000' >But when a few days after the sale you learn
that Mimi has stayed the cruel hand of the law
by the sale of half her jewels, and sent out invitations
to her nearest friends for a housewarming
and a costume ball <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chez elle</span></i> Sunday night,
you begin to see the advertising feature of the
scheme, and realize something of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i> of
Mimi.</p>

<p class='c000' >The opening of the first small bar in Paris
managed by women happened only a score of
years ago and met with a furor of popularity,
the receipts reaching often three thousand
francs a day. Since then the number of bars
has grown yearly until now many of them are
constantly on a point of failure owing to the increase
of competition.</p>

<p class='c000' >Most of them have become the idling resorts
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitués</span> of the new and old <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeunesse</span></i> with
small fortunes, who spend hours therein chatting
with the Mimis and Claras who chance to drop
in daily.</p>

<p class='c000' >The best class of our bars would never become
popular with the average Parisian, for the
reason that there are no Mimis or Claras in
them to talk to. The Parisian demands that at
least a certain part of his day should be spent in
the society of women, and it has been the habit
of his life to have them about him as much as
possible. The hours he is forced to spend at
his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bureau</span></i> or in the Bourse he considers only as a
necessary means to the pleasures of his leisure.</p>

<p class='c000' >In these bars it has become a general custom
to serve a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d’hôte</span> dinner at eight to the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitués</span> and to any stranger who may feel himself
sufficiently at home to stay.</p>

<p class='c000' >These small public dinner parties are amusing.
As a rule the menu is plain and excellent
and the guests agreeable.</p>

<p class='c000' >Just such a place is the new bar in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue
Duphot</span>, a somewhat pretentious little room
smartly appointed and crowded nightly. Another
is in a corner opposite the Madeleine, its
narrow interior dazzling at night in a profusion
of yellow brocade and electricity. Such bars as
these are of the newer class, but there are others
far more attractive in their simplicity, such
as the one in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue du Helder</span> and in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue
Taitbout</span> and the old London bar in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue
Lysly</span>, and others in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue St. Honoré</span> and in
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue Louis-le-Grand</span>, yet in none of these
has the character remained unchanged, for
some of them have had a dozen new proprietors
in the last five years.</p>

<p class='c000' >A most excellent establishment is Henry’s bar
in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue Volnay</span>, the most American in its type
existing in Paris. It is patronized by old and
young from the incoming steamers. If you wish
to shut out Paris from your mind, drop in at
Henry’s any afternoon at five; it is precisely as
tho you had been magically transported back to
the Hoffman House.</p>

<p class='c000' >You will hear Southern colonels there still
harping on the war, and shrewd politicians from
up York State telling personal anecdotes of Mr.
Platt, you will find well-groomed men dropping
in for a friendly cocktail before dinner, and you
will learn all about the fall business in ladies’
“plain velours,” the button trust, the latest details
of the corner on babies’ caps, and how Max
Dindlehoofer held up Poughkeepsie with a new
brand of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">champagne brut</span></i>—but all this is not Parisian
and we may dismiss it.</p>

<p class='c000' >The annual invasion of foreigners supports the
big hotels and the shops of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue de la Paix</span>
and the adjacent neighborhood, but the foreigner
makes little impression upon the average
Parisian, who regards the coming of the “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">étranger</span></i>”
as a small incident in the life of his beloved
city. He passes him unconsciously as one
passes the corner of his street.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic014'>

<p>A QUIET HOUR</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >“They come and go and we are not conscious
of them,” said a Parisian to me. “Besides,” he
added, “there are tens of thousands of Parisians
whose daily life is confined to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quartiers</span></i> in
which they live—big sections of the city where
the foreigner seldom finds himself.”</p>

<p class='c000' >If you wish to see every type of Parisian go
by in an endless stream of swarming humanity,
seat yourself upon any of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">terrasses</span></i> of the
grand cafés that line the sides of the grand
Boulevards stretching from the Madeleine to
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre du Gymnase</span>. It is of all Paris the
most frequented—the broad highway of this
vast city into which pour the inhabitants of
thousands of connecting byways.</p>

<p class='c000' >Its stones are worn by the tramp and scuffle
of countless thousands pausing to gaze at the
crowded <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">terrasses</span></i> or to stop for an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">apéritif</span></i>. The
system with which these popular <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">terrasses</span></i> are
managed by the generals and their lieutenants in
charge of an army of hurrying waiters is perfect.
These head-waiters in command of the sidewalk
portion of these establishments will note
your arrival and departure with the quickness
with which a telephone operator detects the
dropping of one of a thousand numbers on a central
switchboard. During the rush you can spend
hours over a six sous <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bock</span></i>, but when you leave,
your table will be filled before you have mingled
with the passing stream of humanity in front.</p>

<p>READY FOR AN OUTING</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >The types composing this multitude are as
varied as the ever-changing pattern in a kaleidoscope.
Every step you take brings you past a
dozen individuals each one different from the
other. Turn quickly, and count them if you can.
The last moment has brought you by a motley
score of merchants, a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cocotte</span></i>, an Arab sheik, a
ragpicker, a lady, a Japanese, a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boulevardier</span></i>, a
simple soldier, an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">officier</span></i>, two <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gamins</span>, and a
pretty girl with a bundle. As you turn, a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">camelot</span></i>,
running in a pair of dirty canvas slippers,
screams the latest edition of “La Patrie” in your
ears, and a man in a top hat begs your pardon
for having jostled you in the ribs. There is no
time for formalities—he disappears in the
stream and you are borne on with the tide to
the corner. Taking advantage of a second’s
halt of the passing cabs, you dodge over to the
opposite curb and into another section of the
multitude. The crossing which you have just
left behind is noisy with the snapping of whips
and swearing <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cochers</span></i>. In many of these carriages
one catches a glimpse of fair women. In
a passing cab a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blanchisseuse</span></i> and her sweetheart
are enjoying a chance drive, with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span>’s tardy
wash deposited in a huge basket beside the
good-natured <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cocher</span></i>. Old women pushing small
carts cry their wares: “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les belles pêches, voilà
les belles pêches, dix sous la livre!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c000' >Three long-haired students go whistling by.
In the midst of the throng you hear bits of conversation:</p>

<p class='c000' >“Listen!” says a pretty woman radiant over
some news to her companion—but they are
gone.</p>

<p class='c000' >Two more go by furious. “It was he then
who lied!” cries one to the other—but the
crowd swallows them up.</p>

<p class='c000' >Sentences from strange languages reach your
ears in the throng, scraps of Turkish, the guttural
of some passing savage, now the cold
drawl of an Englishman, again the soft lisp from
a Spanish signorita.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Say, Bill, you’d orter seen Charley, they
didn’t do a thing to him, I told Lil, says
I ...” and two fellow-citizens stride on.</p>

<p class='c000' >At the corner, jostled by the human tide, two
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chic demoiselles</span></i> fresh from a rehearsal at a nearby
theater pass, laughing over some recent adventure.
The next instant they are climbing to the
top of an omnibus and are rattling away toward
La Villette.</p>

<p class='c000' >At night this great highway is ablaze with
lights and the swarm still passes, augmented
by the masses who have poured from the shops.
By eight the restaurants and theaters are full to
overflowing, but there is no diminution in the
stream of passers-by along the boulevards. The
only hours when the life there seems slack is
when the masses are at work or in bed. There
are no people who enjoy their city more than do
Parisians, or who use its thoroughfares so much
as a place of pleasure.</p>

<p class='c000' >The cafés along the boulevards are frequented
by a vast <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clientèle</span></i> of men and women of every
clime and occupation. These cafés are favorite
places for rendezvous. In one of them a
man glances from time to time to his watch over
his paper as he awaits his friend. At the next
table a blonde with steel-gray eyes awaits
someone, she does not know whom. But there
is no hurry in either case.</p>

<p class='c000' >Parisians never rush. They do not say,
“Meet me at three thirty-five,” as we do.
“Good, it is understood, my friend,” the Parisian
will say as he bids you good-bye; “I shall
look for you then for the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">apéritif</span></i> at Pousset’s.”
You must not remind him of his tardiness if he
does not arrive until half past six, or be surprised
if you see him patiently waiting for you at three.
They do things that way in France.</p>

<p class='c000' >From Christmas to New Year’s the boulevards
become still more picturesque. Hundreds of
booths are erected along the entire route. At
night gasoline lamps flare from the stands of
fakirs and venders of toys and cheap novelties
who cry their wares. For ten sous you can
buy “The Last Sigh of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Humbert</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000' >There are endless mechanical toys for children,
and the latest inventions for the household,
the inevitable lamp-burner so economical
that it actually puts a dividend in your bank if
used long enough.</p>

<p class='c000' >There are to be had for a few sous marvelous
potato-peelers which turn with one twist of the
wrist the most modest <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuisinière</span></i> into a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cordon bleu</span></i>.
And lightning eradicators for bachelors’ grease-spots,
altho many of the benedicts who came to
buy needed a stronger mixture than was contained
in the neat package with instructions, to
render themselves immaculate.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Allons! allons! mesdames et messieurs</span></i>,” shouts
a man in a wig and a silk hat. “With my wonderful
invention the misery of old age vanishes.
It is a veritable fountain of youth! With it the
old become young and youth stays off advancing
years! I not only sell it but I give you free the
receipt, and all for the price of ten sous.” And
the fakir runs his fingers through his wig and
throws back the lapels of his shining frock-coat
stained green by years of inclement weather.</p>

<p class='c000' >And there is still another, the gentleman fakir,
robust and faultlessly dressed, who is an expert
in drawing a crowd, accenting words of promises
that stay the feet of those hurrying in front of
his flaring lamps. He shows the glittering contents
of the box he offers complete for a franc.
Pandora would have thrown her own away in
the ash heap had she seen half its tempting
contents. “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mesdames et messieurs</span></i>, I would have
to lie if I told you that ever before was such an
offer made to the public, and, as you may be
justly inquisitive as to how it is possible to give
all this for the small sum of one franc, let me tell
you that it is for an advertisement only that I
make this stupendous offer—for the night only,
and nowhere else and at no other time will you
get such an opportunity. Now, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mesdames et
messieurs</span></i>, follow me closely; for one franc I give
this watch, a superb present by itself; with the
watch, this chain and cross, bound to please any
young lady; with the chain and cross, this silver
bracelet that will fit any arm; with the bracelet,
this exquisite pocket-book, also in silver,
lined with silk; with the purse, a handsome set
of studs for a gentleman. Who would not be
proud to own such as these?” And he placed
his fat hand over his heart. “And, finally, with
all this,” he
bellowed on,
“a miniature
brooch. Now,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mesdames et
messieurs</span></i>, see
for yourselves.
Step up, step
up!” And the
fakir pushed
back his silk
hat on the
back of his
head, wiped
his perspiring
forehead, dived
in a little red
trunk studded
with brass
nails, and took
out a dozen
boxes to satisfy
the outstretched hands. He had the crowd
going and he knew it.</p>

<p class='c000' >At a distance of ten feet, under the glare of the
light and handled cleverly, the display of gorgeous
trinkets might have come from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue
de la Paix</span>. His audience became enthusiastic.
The hypnotist in the shining tile rattled on, and,
while his hands were making change and producing
from the two small brass coffers the
packages of treasures, his eyes searched for
those about to weaken. The francs poured in,
and I recalled the words of Mr. Barnum: “The
public the world over likes to be fooled.”</p>

<p class='c000' >On <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span> days and holidays the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boulevard
Sébastopol</span> is swarming with an ever-moving
mass of humanity. It is one continuous bargain
counter from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place du Châtelet</span> to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grand
Boulevard</span>. Here the bazaars and dry-goods
and provision stores do most of their trade on
the sidewalk. The fronts of some are festooned
with whole cartloads of pheasants, rabbits and
hares, and with dozens of deer and wild boar
strung up at a bargain. There are other façades
ornamented with cheap clothes of the “nobby
suits for gents’ order,” and hardware bazaars
and cut-rate sales on roasted coffee, boots, shoes
and cheap silk petticoats.</p>

<p class='c000' >The cafés along the boulevard are for the
most part dingy and unpretentious, but they
suffice as resting-places to many from the passing
stream of humanity. Women without hats,
with their market baskets; the pretty daughters
of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concierges</span></i> out for a day’s bargaining; hundreds
of the wretchedly poor; families of country <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeois</span></i>;
the tough with his middle swathed in a
red scarf and his black hair reversed in greasy
wisps slicked over his ears, his mate a girl in a
red jacket, with a bit of ribbon serving as a
collar, her black hair twisted on the top of her
head and shining in pomade. This pair hurry
along together, he with the easy gait of a thief,
she with her red hands in her pockets, her feet
in low-heeled slippers buttoned with a strap,
treads on by his side, her eyes scanning the
pavement. He has promised to give her a new
pair of slippers with high red heels. To-night
she will be a queen at the ball of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boule
Rouge</span>,” coveted by other thieves. Farther
along a crowd is struggling to take advantage
of a cut-price in chickens, and a fat <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">commerçant</span></i>
with a red face squeezes his way out holding a
pair of bargain broilers. It is a boulevard of the
people, a rendezvous for the thrifty and the hard-working,
the thoroughfare of the outcast and the
unfortunate. It is sordid, but it is intensely
human. It is this distinct character of Parisian
thoroughfares, each one differing from its neighbor,
which makes the highways and byways of
the city so interesting to those who delight in
walking abroad with their eyes open.</p>

<p class='c000' >There is not a street one turns down but which
is unique in itself. In the shops along the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue
de la Paix</span>” the art of satisfying the demands of
vanity and the whims of the luxurious has been
brought to perfection. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue de la Paix</span> is
looking its prettiest at noon, the hour when all
the little <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ouvrières</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">modèles</span></i> from the smart
dressmaking and millinery establishments pour
out for their luncheon, happy as school-girls
during recess.</p>

<p class='c000' >If it happens to be a sunny noon with the blue
sky as a setting to the gilded balconies brilliant
in roses, geraniums and trailing ivy, you will see
the street below alive with these merry little
women, each one vying with the other in the
neatness of her coiffure and the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chic</span></i> of her simple
black frock and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourreau</span></i>. They promenade chatting,
joking and gossiping, without their hats,
for no little <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ouvrière</span></i> ever thinks of wearing one
until her day’s work is over.</p>

<p class='c000' >With the exception of the working classes,
the average <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parisienne</span> is not beautiful. It is her
chicness, her vivacity, and her innate knowledge
of the artificial which makes her attractive, for
not all the actresses in Paris are in the theaters.</p>

<p class='c000' >In stormy weather you may go to the arcades.
These covered <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passages</span></i>, which have existed
through so many Parisian epochs, are honeycombed
with shops full of novelties. Such are the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Passage de l’Opéra</span>, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Passage des Panoramas</span>
and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Passage Choiseul</span>. How many hearts of
French children have palpitated as they were
dragged through the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Passage Jouffroy</span>, containing
the very workshop of Santa Claus himself!
It is a paradise of things that squeak and wind
up; rattling railroad trains which swing around
tin curves and under painted tunnels with a rapidity
sufficient to suffocate the helpless toy passengers
within; toys for poor little good children
and rich little spoiled ones, dolls whose deportment
is faultless and whose vocabulary is limited
to “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">papa</span>” and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maman</span>” and those who can not
say a word, but whose clothes, from the tiny hat
to their walking-boots, with an accompanying
trousseau containing a summer and winter automobile
coat, goggles and all, might have been
fashioned by a Worth. Not even in the public
squares are the soldiers of France more immortalized
than in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Passage Jouffroy</span>. There are
whole forts full of Germans ready to be blown to
smithereens by the gallant advancing force of
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Français</span></i>, and formidable cannons mounted on
sanded ramparts with pill boxes containing
enough ammunition for the most glorious of
victories, to say nothing of the gorgeous <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pièce de
résistance</span></i>, the satin pantalooned <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">balanceur</span></i> with
violet eyes that close like an owl’s, who accomplishes
the most difficult gymnastics by little fits
and starts to the accompaniment in liquid tones
of a music-box tearing through the overture of
William Tell in waltz time.</p>

<p class='c000' >There are also tens of thousands of people
who come to gaze at the shops and the passing
throng, to whom it is a treat to pass an evening
among the throng and lights, and to whom from
childhood the mere fact of a promenade has
been accepted as a pleasure. You can see them
with their wives and children, for Paris counts
an endless number of these <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits ménages</span></i> where
money is scant, work ill paid, and where the
habit of the most rigid economy is practised
from one year’s end to the other. There is next
to no allowance in the budget for pleasure, and
the glamour of the street, the ever changing
interest of the shop windows, and the warmth
and comfort of the cafés, are the only recreations
within their means.</p>

<p class='c000' >Christmas eve is celebrated in every café and
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brasserie</span></i> by a “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réveillon</span></i>,” and for days tables are
taken in advance for this gay celebration.
Supper is served at midnight and the champagne
flows on until broad daylight, and by 2:00 A.M.
the cafés are in an uproar of jollity. Their interiors
present a brilliant sight, and the informality
and good nature of a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bal masqué</span></i> reign supreme
until the light of dawn creeps through the
windows. So great is the crowd at many of the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réveillons</span></i> that the entrance doors are forced to
be closed at midnight. At the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Taverne Royale</span>,
at Pousset’s, at the Café de Paris and dozens of
other places equally celebrated, there is no gayer
sight to be seen throughout a Parisian year.</p>

<p class='c000' >On New Year’s Eve all Paris is merry.</p>

<p class='c000' >New Year’s is of more importance to the
French than Christmas and is made much of.
It is the custom to send bonbons and flowers
to one’s friends, and to acquaintances cards
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000' >In the booths the “ready-while-you-wait”
printers do a thriving trade, and the stores for
bonbons are open until long past midnight. The
stroke of twelve announcing the new year is a
signal for all of Paris to embrace. In the cafés
along the thronged boulevards and in the public
balls you will see the general custom carried
out with considerable zest.</p>

<div class='imgleft c014'   >

<p class='c000' >High up in Montmartre at the ball of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moulin de la Galette</span> on the last night of the
year, at the approach of midnight the roll of a
drum announced the hour, and Father Time
with his scythe appeared in the orchestra gallery
and melodramatically waved good-by to
the old year. Twelve! pealed out the bells, and
a great cheer rose from the dancers. Father
Time became a youth bearing a placard 1903,
and a thousand dancing couples stopped to embrace
and wish each other “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une bonne année</span></i>.”
Simultaneously the orchestra crashed into a
lively <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">galop</span></i>, glasses
were drained,
fresh corks popped
from fizzing bottles
amid cheers
and screams.
Everyone was
happy, and perhaps
a few turned
over a new leaf.</p>

“Mesdames et
Messieurs,”
announced the genial
major-domo of
the cabaret. “I
have the honor to
present to you our
sympathetic comrade
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle
Marcelle Tournon</span>
in her <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">répertoire</span>.”
He bowed low to a
pretty dark-haired
woman advancing
through the crowded
aisle, and, extending
his hand, led her ceremoniously to the
platform in front of the piano.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Come, friends,” cried the director, his ruddy
face beaming with enthusiasm, “a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">double-ban</span></i> of
applause for our distinguish artiste.”</p>

<p class='c000' >Simultaneously there rose a cheer from the
roomful of bohemians followed by a double
round of handclapping in appreciative greeting.
Then, settling themselves beneath the rifts of
pipe and cigarette smoke, they remained quiet
to listen to the singer. Marcelle smiled graciously
in recognition. The owl-like accompanist
ran a light <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">arpeggio</span></i> over the keys, and the singer,
raising her music, poured forth her mellow voice
in “Pierrot.” “Poor Pierrot, you could not
give a necklace to Columbine,” sang Marcelle,
“and so she left you. Columbine, grown vain
and selfish, leaves you to shiver and think in
your garret. The strings of your lute are
broken, the tunes will not come any more, and
your poor heart is aching from a cruel little
crack clear across it that never, never, can be
mended.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Columbine fluttered like a butterfly out to
the glitter of the world. Thorns scratched her
in the garden as she hurried on, and beyond
the wall of their paradise she found the world,
but it was not at all like the world of her
dreams. The rain faded her pretty dress, and
hunger shriveled her delicate body; meanwhile
the multitude rushed by her unheeding.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Poor Pierrot! How she craved the sound of
his voice now, his trustful eyes, the cool touch
of his white cheeks! How merry were the tunes
he strummed for her!</p>

<p class='c000' >“She crawled back as best she could to what
was once their paradise; she found herself at
last at the gate, and, swallowing her pride,
pulled the latch and entered the garden.</p>

<p class='c000' >“The place was silent. The flowers drooped
their heads; not even her old friends the roses
nodded to her as she flew on up the path to the
house. Here she paused to listen again. A bat
squeaked in the eaves over her head, and in terror
she pushed open the door and climbed the
rickety stairs.</p>

<p class='c000' >“‘Pierrot! Pierrot!’ she cried, and in the garret
she found her Pierrot huddled upon a bed of
straw, his poor white face turned towards the
wall. Columbine called to him, feebly first, then
in a frenzy, but he did not speak. A string of the
lute snapped in the silence and Columbine sank
down in a little heap, and cried, and cried, and
cried. And they say that days afterwards the
birds found them and covered them with leaves.”</p>

<p class='c000' >The song was ended and Marcelle, amid a
thunderous applause, joined a group of singers
awaiting their turn.</p>

<p class='c000' >As nightly my pipe added to the hazy atmosphere
of the cabaret, I came to know Marcelle
better. She was a woman of thirty, beautiful
when she sang, fascinating when she smiled,
but in repose her clean-cut features were saddened
with the hardships of a bohemian life
which had been not only a wearing struggle for
recognition, but even one for existence. She
often spoke of her present country home, of
her garden, and how busy she was with it all in
the hours in which she was free from the cafés-concerts
and the cabarets. I thought I could
discover upon a closer glance a tinge of sunburn
in her complexion, and her hands looked like
those of a woman who spent much of her life
digging in her garden.</p>

<p class='c000' >“You must come and see my garden,” she
said one night, “it is on the summit of Montmartre,
on the very top of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span>. Ah! you
should see the view from there! All Paris lies
below. It is not like a city up there at all as
you shall see; it is quite like a little country village.
Come! I will show you how to find it,”
and, taking a scrap of paper from her music
roll, she drew me a plan, a zig-zag route up
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span> which, she assured me if I carefully
followed it, would lead me in due time to her
tiny villa.</p>

<p>GEORGES WAGUE, A CELEBRATED PIERROT</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >“I call it the Villa Polichinelle,” she said.
“That is a good name, is it not! It is only a little
joke of a house any way. It is the last one
as you turn down the lane and go through the
orchard. The others are all occupied, so you see
I have neighbors. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Franelli</span>, a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">danseuse</span>
at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Opéra</span> and her two daughters, live in the
first house. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Thérèse</span>, the youngest, took a
prize at the Conservatoire. She is very beautiful;
you may remember her at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Châtelet</span>, a
slight blonde, exquisitely made. It is in her
blood to dance well; her mother was once a
great dancer but is almost an invalid now and
rarely goes on.</p>

<p class='c000' >“In the second lives a poet of Montmartre;
the third is occupied by a famous old clown; a
painter has the fourth; and Duflos, the comedian,
the fifth. You see we are quite a colony of
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">artists</span></i> together. We call it ‘our village,’ and
have elected Duflos as Mayor and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur
Dallet</span>, the clown, as chief of police. Dear old
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Dallet</span>, he would not hurt a fly, his
heart is so big!</p>

<p class='c000' >“Come Sunday morning. I will show you my
tulips and we can breakfast in the garden.”</p>

<p class='c000' >And Marcelle rolled up her music and hurried
away to sing at another cabaret.</p>

<p class='c000' >I folded the all important plan with its
scraggly route carefully in my portfolio.</p>

<p class='c000' >Sunday dawned clear and sparkling in sunshine,
so to the garden I started. Leaving my
cab at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">place Blanche</span>, I began my ascent of
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span> by way of the steep <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue Lepic</span>, pausing
for breath under the ancient windmill of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moulin de la Galette</span>.</p>

<p class='c000' >Up! up! up! out of Paris, for the city now lay
shimmering in a haze of sunshine below. The
spires of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Notre-Dame</span> and the massive roof of
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Opéra</span> jutted from a sea of streets and buildings.
And so I kept on up the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span>, past a
cobbler who kept a cow. I was crawling now
like a fly over the bald cranium beneath which,
as all good <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmartrois</span></i> will tell you, lie the brains
of Paris.</p>

<p class='c000' >I turned up quaint streets, many of them lined
with two-story houses of ancient pattern, which
leaned for support upon their sturdier neighbors,
who in turn rely upon great beams shored
against their crumbling backs. I sat down by
the roadside to re-study my plan. “To the left,”
it said, and I kept on. A flock of geese waddled
indignantly ahead of me and, crossing the road,
disappeared under a fence. Nearby some
chickens scratched and pecked away in front of
a doorway whose threshold was worn and
polished by the passing feet of a hundred years.
I peeped through high fences behind which lay
orchards and wild gardens grown picturesque
from neglect, and farther on I passed an ancient
burial-ground.</p>

<p class='c000' >Here the narrow streets were unpaved and at
night gloomily lighted by an occasional oil lantern,
friendly safeguards to the wayfarer obliged
to turn these corners after dark.</p>

<p class='c000' >I confess I was grateful for the sunlight, as I
imagined how this strange quarter would look
at night, and recalled to mind that the notorious
Cabaret of the Assassins lay upon an isolated
ledge of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span> but a stone’s throw away.</p>

<p class='c000' >Finally, at the end of a lane I came to a gate,
and, entering, found my way through a tangled
orchard leading to a small settlement of frame
houses fronting on a winding path. I looked
about for the inevitable <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concierge</span></i>, to whom to
disclose my identity and ask permission to enter
this bohemian community, when, with a growl,
an ugly-looking dog rushed to the end of his
chain and, with his scrubby neck bristling, stood
eyeing me viciously. Over his kennel was
printed in blue letters “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Concierge</span></i>,” evidently the
work of Marcelle’s neighbor, the “clown,” I
thought. Measuring the length of the brute’s
chain and the circle it would describe, if swung
in my direction, I shied by him and kept on my
way. At the narrowest part of the path I found
another sign: “Room for three automobiles
only.” Over the door of the smallest house I
read: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Château</span> of the Duke and Duchess of
Montmartre.” I passed the poet’s house, a little
box of a place, half smothered in a tangled garden.
He had decorated his modest façade with
the verses of Villon and Verlaine; a satyr in
stone rose from a labyrinth of flowers, and
nearby a marble nymph, bathing in a miniature
pool, peered laughingly from her hiding-place at
the immovable satyr. Art was far more cheaply
to be had there than three meals a day.</p>

<p class='c000' >The pathway now ran through a short thicket.
Beyond it lay the crest of the lane, an expanse
of blue sky, and, nestling in the prettiest of tiny
gardens, the “Villa Polichinelle.”</p>

<p class='c000' >Marcelle, who had been watching me find my
way, now called to me from an upper window,
and came down to greet me in a sunbonnet and
a calico wrapper.</p>

<p class='c000' >“I am so glad you have come,” she said,
cheerily. “And did the plan work well?” she
added, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Perfectly,” I replied. “Only you did not put
in the dog.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“Ah! Cerbère—yes, I know. He growled at
you because you were a stranger. He is not a
bad old fellow, tho, when you know him; you
see he seems to feel responsible for us.”</p>

<p class='c000' >I could not help shivering at the thought
that Marcelle came home long after midnight,
often alone, through rain, snow and slush, passing,
to get to this mountain retreat, through
one of the worst quarters of Paris, inhabited
for the most part by gentlemen and their consorts
whose records are as black as the ace of
spades.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Now,” said my hostess, “you must see all of
my modest kingdom. First my garden, then my
family, and then my house.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“Good,” said I, “the garden shall come first.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“Ah! I am glad you love flowers,” cried Marcelle,
growing enthusiastic as I complimented
her upon the beauty of her roses. She threw
aside her sunbonnet and led me triumphantly to
a bed of red and yellow tulips, which was edged
by a row of box skirting the neatly-raked gravel
path, so characteristic of French gardens.</p>

<p class='c000' >“I planted them all myself,” said Marcelle,
“except this last row, which the poet helped me
to do. You see they are jumbled—as I told him,
like some of his verses. He is a symbolist, you
know. Nothing the poet writes can one ever
understand. But he says we all will do so some
day—that the cheap realism of the present will
soon sink into oblivion and be forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c000' >There were beds of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">giroflees</span></i>, masses of pinks,
odd corners of velvety pansies, and bower-like
arbors covered with Jacqueminot roses. We
descended some stepping-stones to a smaller
lower garden and entered a thatched kiosk lined
with turkey red, upon which were hung bas-reliefs
and pen-and-ink drawings, souvenirs from
those who loved the good-fellowship of this
Arcadian nook.</p>

<p class='c000' >And now Juliette, Marcelle’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne</span>, her sleeves
rolled over the elbows of her plump arms, came
to the kiosk with vermouth and cigarettes. Following
her, a green parrot pigeontoed his way
down the gravel walk, muttering to himself a
jumble of phrases.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Come, my good Jacquot!” called Marcelle to
the parrot. “Jacquot is one of my family; you
shall see the others: my cat, my big Frou-Frou,
and her pretty kittens, and the pigeons, and all
the rest of the ménagerie after <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c000' >Jacquot climbed to the table and bent his
beak to his breast. While Marcelle rubbed the
pinfeathers of his green neck, he clucked and
sang to himself in delight. Then he shook himself,
dilated the pupils of his yellow eyes as he
took a careful look at me, and, having satisfied
himself as to my character, pigeontoed his way
slowly to my shoulder. He sang quite clearly a
song that Marcelle had taught him:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J’ai du bon tabac dans ma tabatière,</span></i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J’ai du bon tabac, tu n’en auras pas.</span></i>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >Half an hour later Juliette laid the table in the
kiosk for breakfast, with two extra places set for
the clown and the poet, who both came late,
with endless apologies to Marcelle for their
tardiness.</p>

<p class='c000' >“There had been an extra rehearsal at the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nouveau Cirque</span>,” explained the merry old fun-maker,
and he mopped his brow, perspiring from
his quick walk up the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span>. Marcelle straightway
forgave him, and further cheered him with
an affectionate pat on the top of his shining bald
pate as he slid into his chair. As he unfolded his
napkin there tumbled into his lap a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boutonnière</span></i> of
mignonette, which our hostess had thoughtfully
hidden for her old comrade. He had been her
counselor and friend, often sharing with her the
little he had during her days of penury, for Marcelle’s
life, as I have said, had been from babyhood
a struggle for existence. She was a flower
that had fought its way to the sunshine from
between the stones of Paris.</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c000' >“And you, my big rabbit!” cried Marcelle,
addressing the poet with the air of a judge;
“what have you to say for yourself in apology
for being late?” The poet sighed, ran his
fingers through his long hair, hung his black hat
upon a convenient peg, and, drawing up his
chair, replied, wearily: “Would that I might
join Sylvia and her nymphs and drink and be
merry by the moon and not by the hour!”</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Flûte!</span></i>” replied Marcelle. “Don’t you suppose
they had the best of regular appetites in
those days and quarreled if the soup was late?
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Allons, mangez, mes enfants</span></i>, and be grateful that
the sun shines and we have enough for to-day.”</p>

<p class='c000' >After <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</span></i> the clown and the poet played
shuttlecock and quoits in the garden. The poet
met ignominious defeat, for the aged gentleman,
whose life had been spent on the sawdust, was a
dead shot with a quoit and as agile as a weasel.
Later we all went into the villa for a song, the
clown playing Marcelle’s accompaniments upon
a melodeon. Some of its keys emitted cries of
distress, and this furnished the clown with an
impromptu pantomime that sent Marcelle into
screams of laughter. So the afternoon passed
with songs, Madeira and cigarettes.</p>

<p class='c000' >If the garden was interesting, the interior of
the little villa was none the less so, for it was
a miniature museum of souvenirs.</p>

<p class='c000' >The walls of the small salon were covered with
pastels. There were original drawings and bas-reliefs
by celebrated men. Pen-and-ink sketches,
caricatures, charcoals and oils, each one bearing
a little message of regard and friendship to
Marcelle, lined the walls of the narrow stairs
leading to the dainty boudoir.</p>

<p class='c000' >Even the kitchen, shining in its well-polished
battery of copper saucepans, held its art
treasures.</p>

<p class='c000' >It was nearly dusk when the poet and I took
our leave of our charming hostess and the “Villa
Polichinelle.”</p>

<p class='c000' >The clown had been obliged to hurry away
earlier to attend some affairs preliminary to the
night’s performance.</p>

<p class='c000' >As the poet and I descended the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span> together,
all Paris lay spread out in the evening
glow below us.</p>

<p class='c000' >It lay like a vast gray sea sparkling and phosphorescent
with tens of thousands of lights.
Far below, away in the twilight, jutted the spires
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Notre-Dame</span>; to the right rose the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Opéra</span>,
square and massive like a tomb.</p>

<p class='c000' >I thought of Marcelle’s paradise perched in
the pure air above the reek and filth that hung
like a miasma about the base of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span>, and
what it meant to her as a refuge from the smoke
and stifling air of cabarets and cafés-concert.</p>

<p class='c000' >We kept on through the alleys of streets, zig-zagging
our way down the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span>, and turned
the corner of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cabaret des Assassins</span>. A
kerosene lamp burned in the greasy kitchen,
from the door of which a hag of a woman appeared
and screeched at us as we passed:</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonsoir!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c012' >It was in midwinter one misty morning in
January when I revisited the primitive village
upon the summit of Montmartre. This time I
chose for my trail a back street which led me up
to the ancient Cabaret of the Assassins, now
known under the name of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lapin Agil</span>. The
cabaret, a squat, sordid two-story structure,
stands upon a solitary corner of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span>, forming
an angle with the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue Saint Vincent</span> and
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue des Saules</span>. Overlooking Paris below,
a back window glared in the light of the chill
morning from beneath an overhanging eave, like
the eye of a murderer in hiding. The place as I
entered was silent and deserted except for the
individuals who kept it.</p>

<p class='c000' >A girl of fifteen addressed me in a timid voice
as I entered the low-ceiled <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">buvette</span></i> adjoining the
cabaret. She wore a massive marriage ring.
She seemed somewhat frightened and suspicious,
as tho I were a government detective armed
with a warrant.</p>

<p class='c000' >We spoke of the weather.</p>

<p class='c000' >She directed me to a bench in the deserted
cabaret, stale with the odor of the night before,
and brought me a short glass with a thick bottom.
Into this she poured a draft of syrupy
vermouth and apologized for the absence of her
mother, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patronne</span></i>, who had not yet returned
from market.</p>

<p class='c000' >Not many came by there in the morning, she
ventured, but at night it was gay, the cabaret
was then crowded she informed me, and leaving
me with my <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">apéritif</span></i> she disappeared through the
door leading to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">buvette</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000' >Upon the walls of the cabaret hung cartoons
and crude sketches left in later years by bohemian
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitués</span> who made the place their rendezvous.</p>

<p class='c000' >In a corner stood a piano, its keys yellow with
age like the teeth of a horse.</p>

<p class='c000' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame</span> the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patronne</span></i>, a slatternly looking
woman in a calico wrapper, returns from marketing
with two mackerel which she had bargained
for from a push-cart in the street below. She led
me through a box of a kitchen and showed me a
small yard in the rear littered with debris. This
she informed me was used as a summer garden
in season. She seemed to pride herself upon its
attractiveness. I passed an open door of a back
room and caught a glimpse of a man leaning
over a table, drunk, and unshaven for days. He
looked up at me maliciously as I past; then I
heard him muttering and swearing in his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">argot</span></i> at
the girl with the rolled-gold ring.</p>

<p class='c000' >From the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patronne</span></i> I learned that the cabaret
had gone through many changes. It was evident,
however, that the general atmosphere had
remained the same. It looked all that its title
of the Assassins implied. The muddy streets
leading to it were unpaved and lighted still by
an oil lantern at the corner of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue St. Vincent</span>,
a sinister looking lane flanked by ancient buttressed
walls, which kept from sliding into the
crooked roadbed old tangled gardens and scattered
derelicts of houses.</p>

<p class='c000' >The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue Tholozé</span>, snaking its way up from the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue Lepic</span> to the ball of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moulin de la Galette</span>,
is purely a hill street. Its gutters are flushed
with clear water which flows in miniature torrents.
Horses never climb the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue Tholozé</span>, and
pedestrians going up to the ball pause at the
landing stages for breath. Those living along
this mountain highway must needs step out of
their residences with their sea legs on, for the
declivity which slopes past their doorways resembles
somewhat the angle of a promenade deck
in a gale. The hill begins to ascend in earnest
after you pass the dingy little bohemian restaurant
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vache Enragée</span> on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue Lepic</span>, an
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">intime</span></i> rendezvous of bohemians of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span>.</p>

<p class='c000' >With the renovation and reorganization of
the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moulin de la Galette</span>” the famous ball
held for so many generations in the granary
under the ancient windmill took a change for
the better.</p>

<p class='c000' >Prior to this the ball bore an unsavory reputation.
It was the scene of continual fights and
the rendezvous for every villainous <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rapin</span></i> of
Montmartre and their equally vicious female
companions, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gigolettes</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mômes</span></i> of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span>.</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c000' >To-day the spacious ballroom is remodeled
and redecorated with green lattice and crystal
chandeliers in the style of the ballroom of the
old <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête champêtre</span></i>. The orchestra is the best of
its kind in Paris. The floor is kept in perfect
condition and all Montmartre goes to the “Galette”
to dance and be merry. Models, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grisettes</span></i>,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cocottes</span></i>, shop-girls, students and clerks,
painters and musicians, sculptors and poets,
meet and mingle. While its <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clientèle</span> is drawn
from all Paris, the majority of it is <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmartrois</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000' >Adjoining the ballroom is a quaint summer
garden.</p>

<p class='c000' >A flight of wooden steps leads from the garden
to the table-like rock above, crowned by the
ancient windmill bearing the date 1256.</p>

<p class='c000' >I entered the Galette one crisp morning by
way of the lane in the rear and through the door
of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">buvette</span></i>. Sleepy waiters were scrubbing
and polishing after the ball of the night. The
tiled floor of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">buvette</span></i> was as spotless as soap
and water could make it. Some coffee steamed
cheerily on the stove, and the pots and pans
hanging above it shone invitingly. In the ballroom
a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</span> was rewaxing the floor; through
the skylight streamed the morning sun, shining
prismatically through the crystals of the chandeliers.
I went out into the garden and climbed
the stairs leading to the old mill.</p>

<p class='c000' >It stood gaunt and black against the sky, outstretching
its skeleton arms. Its body was
warped and weather-beaten. It seemed to have
died in its shell like some mammoth scorpion.</p>

<p class='c000' >What a “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vie de Bohème</span></i>” it has seen in its
lifetime!</p>

<p class='c000' >It has been danced around by <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grisettes</span></i> and
students in the moonlights and daylights of
ages past, and has served faithfully as a refuge
and fortress during the horrors of the siege of
’71. Beside it still glow the lights of this famous
old ball up to which climb nightly a merry
pilgrimage of the great-grandchildren of Bohemia.</p>

<p class='c012' >Some months ago what is probably the most
noted of bohemian resorts, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moulin Rouge</span>,
closed its doors—the famous Red Mill had come
to an end, and Paris mourned its death in caricature.
For months its façade was barricaded
with scaffolds, and rumor was current that the
old hall was to be transformed into a music-hall.</p>

<p class='c000' >At last after many delays the opening of the
new <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moulin Rouge</span> was announced. The public
poured in to find one of the handsomest of modern
music-halls with a most excellent restaurant.
A <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d’hôte</span> dinner is served at little tables,
glowing in fairy lamps, where one can dine and
watch the performance.</p>

<p class='c000' >Back of this spacious theater for ballets
and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revues</span></i> there is a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">promenoir</span></i> where all of the
old attractions of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moulin Rouge</span> and many
new ones can be seen during the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entr’actes</span></i>, including
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quadrilles</span>. So that after all the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moulin Rouge</span> did not die—rather let us say
that it was born again, and is now all that many
of us expected to find it upon our first visit years
ago and never did; for the Red Mill was then a
tawdry place at best—somewhat of a snare
and a delusion.</p>

<p class='c012' >Montmartre is the kingdom of artistic Bohemia.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span> is honeycombed with the ateliers
of painters and sculptors and the modest
sanctums of struggling poets and musicians.
This is only one side. The other side, like
the degenerate half of some visages, is all that is
vicious and criminal. Back of every blaze of
light in Montmartre there is a shadow, and from
out of many of these dark corners flutter to the
lights of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boulevard de Clichy</span>, like nocturnal
moths, scores of gaudy women—too frequently
the spiders who dare not venture in the sun and
whose claws have been known to have been
smeared with the blood of the helpless more
than once, crawl from these squalid holes beyond
the light.</p>

<p class='c000' >Montmartre is ablaze after midnight, and the
cafés along the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boulevard de Clichy</span> are swarming
with women to whom to-morrow is much
the same as to-day—women who from one year’s
end to the other seldom see the sun, whose
days begin at midnight and whose mind, body
and soul have long ago passed to the trusty
keeping of the devil.</p>

<p class='c000' >There is always one thought uppermost in the
mind of the lady from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue Blanche</span>: it is that
somebody shall pay the waiter as much and as
continuously as possible between midnight and
daylight.</p>

<p class='c000' >There is little about human nature that this
daughter of Montmartre does not know. Her
ears are trained to a marvelous sense of acuteness,
and her intuition and perception make the
shrewdest mind-reader appear as tame as a fortune-telling
horse.</p>

<p class='c000' >The lady from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue Blanche</span> not only
knows precisely what you are thinking about,
but your past, present, and your disastrous future
if you continue her acquaintance. During this
time she will relieve you with the skill of a magician
of your small change, and, if given time,
your entire fortune including your watch. She
will lead you into the worst traps a fertile brain
can invent. Having robbed you of everything
else you possessed, including your senses, some
fine day she will either hand you over to the police
or open fire on you in a jealous rage if only for
the satisfaction of peppering away at your useless
carcass.</p>

<p class='c000' >These <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petites femmes</span></i> of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span> glide by with
the quickness of an area cat. They are reckless,
strong, and fearless, these <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noctambules</span></i>.
The eyes of Fanchette burn brilliantly in their
sockets. Her lips are scarlet with a hasty dab
of rouge. The rest of her visage is as pale as
Pierrot’s. When you look at her with your eyes
half closed, you seem to see her skull.</p>

<p class='c000' >Claudine enters the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbaye de Thélème</span>” at
midnight, the pleats of her white silk petticoat
spread out with the pride of a fantail pigeon.</p>

<p class='c000' >She wears a scarlet jacket studded with
polished brass buttons that catch the light as
she moves. The costume is a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nouveauté</span></i> from the
Montmartre bazaar which has excited the envy
of every other Mimi and Cora along the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boulevard
de Clichy</span> since Wednesday, when Claudine
became the duchess of Montana. This title
was bestowed upon her by a broad-shouldered
cow-puncher of our far West, who insisted upon
the title and dressed her according to his ideas
of how a duchess “oughter look.” A scarlet
hat with a green feather flames upon her head,
and her feet are encased in new gray suede
slippers whose high heels do good service in
elevating the lady to her suddenly exalted position.
On her thumb she wears a ruby ring, a
gift from her cowboy admirer.</p>

<p class='c000' >Lélise glides into the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nouvelle Athénée</span>,” a
café whose <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clientèle</span> is made up of soberer
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitués</span>.</p>

<p class='c000' >She is pretty, this Lélise, a nervous little
blonde with the merriest of blue eyes, and the
pink of neatness, her clothes being fashioned in
the best of Parisian good taste.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dis donc, mon vieux</span></i>,” she calls, clapping her
hands to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</span>.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Un grog bien chaud, et de quoi écrire.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bien, madame</span></i>,” replies the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</span>.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Un Américain, un!</span></i>” he calls, as he hurries
for the portfolio and pen and ink, which he lays
before Lélise quite ceremoniously, while another
waiter brings to her the steaming “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grog
Américain</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c000' >Lélise draws off her gloves with an air of importance
and begins a voluminous correspondence.
Five letters in all, written in a rapid
angular hand like the autographs across the
pictures of soubrettes.</p>

<p class='c000' >Handwriting of this sort has evidently made
its impression upon Lélise. She writes with all
the extravagant flourish of these souvenirs—she
even adds Ys and Ts of her own creation. This
often leads to a reckless use of capitals beginning
words of importance. Furthermore, she
underscores these with savage-looking scratches
meant to emphasize the intensity of her feeling
about whatever comes into her pretty head.
The solemn word, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Amour</span></i>,” is often accented
by two of these parallel lines drawn with unhesitating
decision. Again the tender word,
“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Toujours</span></i>,” is half ripped from the paper by two
formidable underlines, each of them started with
a little dig that makes the pen spatter.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Immédiatement</span></i>,” and words suggesting hate
and jealousy are made to glare out from the
page like danger-signals.</p>

<p class='c000' >But you must not think me guilty of overlooking
the five letters of Lélise—I can vouch only
for the one I received. The aged <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</span>,
François, who brought it over to me hidden in
the folds of a fresh napkin, received it through
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mademoiselle</span>’s gray muff while with the other
hand he helped her escort, a dashing young
officer of the hussars, on with his night-coat.</p>

<p class='c000' >The young officer’s tip slid to the bottom of
François’s pocket, where it clinked against my
own.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >Lélise buttoned her gloves, adjusted her veil,
picked up her skirt and followed her escort to
the door, that François held open, and the two
disappeared in the night.</p>

<p class='c000' >Even in Montmartre there is some discretion.</p>

<p class='c000' >And there is still another type of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmartroise</span></i>.
The woman in this case is often a model of rational
living and rare devotion, sharing the good
and ill luck of her lover with the patience, pluck
and fortitude of a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne fille</span></i> and a good comrade.</p>

<p class='c000' >If her jealous mate growls in his cups during
their dinner in some favorite café, it is she who
averts the row, pacifies the offended gentleman
at the next table, quiets her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amant</span></i> with a kiss,
calls for the bill, sees that it is just, and continues
by her alert brain and her intuition to please
her quarrelsome lover by distracting his pugilistic
mind towards a more peaceful mood.</p>

<p class='c000' >When he wakes up he will be convinced more
than ever that this Parisian <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demoiselle</span> is, after
all, his best friend.</p>

<p class='c000' >If you wish to see “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle</span> of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span>” in all her war-paint, go to the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbaye
de Thélème</span>” after midnight, where you will find
her ready to eat, drink and be merry upon the
slightest provocation. Follow her later to the
Capitol among those who consume little suppers
at big prices during the hours when the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sergents
de ville</span></i>, pacing their beats outside, draw up the
hoods of their night-cloaks to protect them from
the chill of the early morning.</p>

<p class='c000' >Still later you will find this nocturnal <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demoiselle</span>,
the idol of the generously drunk, picking
up her skirts in a bacchanalian revel between the
hours of three and four in the restaurant of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rat Mort</span>. Her eyes shine, her cheeks burn, the
champagne and the lights seem to madden her,
a madness of sheer ecstasy. Life for the moment
is <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en rose</span></i>. She feels herself a queen, defiant,
seductive, dangerously beautiful. Four
dancers from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Casino de Paris</span> arrive amid
screams and applause. Claudine is dancing on
a table; an instant later she is being carried on
the shoulders of a howling mob around the
room. The music is drowned in the cries of
“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bis, bis!</span></i>” One see through the whirl and
glitter and smoke, flashing gems, the shimmer
of silk hose, and the glint of bare arms.</p>

<p class='c000' >Morning begins to pale. The streets are silent
and deserted except for an occasional party
of roisterers issuing from some closing café.
Occasionally a woman passes coughing in the
choking fog of the early morning. The ragpickers
begin to make their rounds.</p>

<p class='c000' >There is still another refuge for this <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle
“Sans Gène</span>.” That is the restaurant
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tréteaux de Tabarin</span> on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue Pigalle</span>.
Upstairs as in all the others there is a supper
room. This one is smaller than the rest and
more <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">intime</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000' >The settees behind the tables are occupied
with those to whom night seems ever too short.
A <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansonnier</span></i> before the piano is singing the waltz
song “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Amoureuse</span>;” many at the tables have
grown pensive under the spell of the singer. A
girl in a décolleté gown at one of the tables is
sobbing hysterically.</p>

<p class='c000' >“It was the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bénédictine</span>,” remonstrates her
companion. “You were <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">imbécile</span></i> to drink so
much, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma chérie</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c000' >From the low ceiling glow electric lamps
shaded with ground glass like those in the
cabin of a yacht.</p>

<p class='c000' >Three women and an old beau are dancing an
impromptu quadrille before the tables.</p>

<p class='c000' >Wisps of tobacco smoke curl lazily up from
the little tables. Some of the cigarettes
smoulder between lips of décolleté women, others
are held shakily between the fingers of hands
blue-veined, pallid and weighted with jewels.
The scent of a score of perfumes hangs in the
reek of smoke. Suddenly there is a scream and
a crash of glass. A gentleman in a damaged
shirt-front has slipped, dragging with him a table
and upsetting the contents of an adjoining one.</p>

<p class='c000' >He falls with a jar which set the lamp globes
in the ceiling to shivering. The wine sweeps
over the table and puddles down on the floor,
soaking through the silk petticoat and lace stocking
of a pretty brunette. Two waiters hurry
with napkins to soak up the wet. When this
bull in a china shop has sufficiently and substantially
apologized, fresh wine bubbles in the
glasses for the victims of the flood.</p>

<p class='c000' >At last the heavy curtains over the windows
are flung open and a white light from without
floods the room, making the eyes sting. It is
broad daylight. Cabs clatter up, are filled, and
rattle away.</p>

<p class='c000' >“By Gad! Charley,” says a portly American
at a corner table to his friend, a short thick-set
man whose mustache is curled in pomade,
“We’d better git along and git some sleep if
we’re going to sell Jake any goods before lunch.
So long, Flossy,” he adds with a yawn, addressing
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mademoiselle</span> who had been supping with them.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonsoir, monsieur</span></i>,” replied the girl in a gentle
voice looking at him steadily as he sways and
relights his cigar, pushing his silk hat in a cooler
position on the back of his head. It did not occur
to him to raise it.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Cute gal,” says the portly man to his friend,
his patent leather shoes squeaking as he walks
ponderously to the door.</p>

<p class='c000' >“One of them swell <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cocottes</span></i>, eh?” replied the
friend, “she seemed to take quite a shine to you,
Bill.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“Hell,” guffaws the portly one, importantly.
“I never give ’em no encouragement.” And the
two stumble down the narrow stairs that lead to
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue Pigalle</span>. In the chilly street the portly
one fumbles for his cigar case.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Smoke one of them light ones, Charley,” he
says, as the two roll into the cab and the fat one
slams the door.</p>

<p class='c000' >Happily there are other types of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmartrois</span></i>
than the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noctambules</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noceurs</span></i> who frequent
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rat Mort</span> and Tabarin.</p>

<p class='c000' >Thousands of domestic honest bourgeois live
on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span> whose lives are spent in stores and
workshops and in caring for their wives and
children. There are many conservative old
families besides these whose children are well
brought up and well educated, by a rigid economy
on the part of parents whose daily bread
has been earned by a long and patient fight.</p>

<p class='c000' >Many of these parents are in the employ of
the government; teachers in the public schools
and in the bureaus of the administration where
they work hard and are but poorly paid. Theirs
are the houses which the stranger rarely if ever
sees. They remind one of the most domestic
and conservative homes of New England. They
seem an anomaly in this Latin civilization.</p>

<p class='c000' >Paris is one of the easiest places in the world
in which to empty one’s pocket, and one of the
most difficult in which to earn an honest penny.
It is the want of money among Parisians and
the difficulty of earning it which in late years
has deadened much of the extravagant gaiety
which once existed. Parisians are content to
adapt their pleasures to their purses.</p>

<p class='c000' >There are scores of men in Montmartre who
began life talented beyond the average in the
arts, and who have sunk by idleness into poverty
and oblivion. Talent alone is not sufficient;
one must improve it and drive it, and many of
these long-haired velvet-cloaked geniuses of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span> are too lazy by nature to do this. Instead,
they adopt a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">genre</span></i> of their own, and despise all
other schools of art, never departing from their
methods in spite of the fact that their incomprehensible
creations seldom bring them a sou. So
they wrap themselves up self-satisfied in their
cloaks, go through life without a hair-cut, tell
you all other art is rot—and starve.</p>

<p class='c000' >This afternoon I followed one of these dream
painters to his studio. The way led up a
crooked street, down a narrow alley, into a court
full of rubbish, up a flight of dingy stairs, down
into another court (this one as dark as the stairs),
up another rickety flight, and so to his door.</p>

<p class='c000' >A feeble light struggled through the cobwebbed
panes of the studio skylight, and the
room was in a state of dirt and disorder.
Tumbled in one corner were a lot of unfinished
canvases, and dumped in another was a pile of
unwashed dishes. A dirty divan canopied after
the fashion of the Roman emperors served as a
bed of state for the great man.</p>

<p class='c000' >That he was once a genius was unquestionable
from the evidence of some of his early works.
He had been a masterly draftsman and a painter
of virility and great richness of color. That is,
when he painted, but this he never did so long
as he possessed a sou. Many of his subjects I
now found difficult to understand, even when he
turned them right side up for me.</p>

<p class='c000' >Some of them seemed prehistoric. Wan wisps
of maidens floated dimly through heavy fogs,
guided by symbols and illuminated by sacred
fires. Some of them had no eyes and trailed
their feet along the ground.</p>

<p class='c000' >This artist was only one of many who cursed
the public for their financial appreciation of popular
modern art, which he termed “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des petites
cochonneries</span></i>!”</p>

<p class='c000' >There is a large class of poets, painters,
sculptors and musicians for whom the wheel of
fortune spins capriciously. Their idle hours are
spent among their comrades in the cabarets and
the little <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boîtes</span></i> tucked away in odd corners of
Montmartre, where they breakfast and dine, accompanied
by their sweethearts.</p>

<p class='c000' >Of the latter they are a type unto themselves
and wholly aloof from the life and night types of
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue Blanche</span>.</p>

<p class='c000' >Gaston the painter is a disciple of Botticelli,
and you find the influence of dress and coiffure of
that period asserting itself in the style of clothes
and arrangement of hair of his sweetheart,
Mariette. With her locks in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bandeaux</span></i> she looks
as saintly as a church picture.</p>

<p class='c000' >Jacques the musician, a composer of sixteenth
century pavans and minuets, has dressed
the fair Amélie in an old-fashioned frock, cut low
about the throat; her pretty face is framed in
two curls, and there is a rose in her hair.</p>

<p class='c000' >Sing, dance and be merry, ye children of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span>! Ye who have inherited the Paradise of
Bohemia, ye who know its every nook and
corner, its bright and its dark days, its poverty
and its riches! The love and the wealth of
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">camaraderie</span></i> is yours. To you the rest of the world
counts for naught.</p>

<p class='c000' >To you, Gaston, a health to Mariette. To you,
Jacques, a toast to “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la Petite Amélie</span>.”</p>

<p class='dc1'>With the passing away of that most
famous of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmartrois</span></i> cabarets, the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chat Noir</span>, artistic Bohemia of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span> met
with a serious loss.</p>

<p class='c000' >The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chat Noir</span> was founded by Salis on the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boulevard Rochechouart</span> in 1881. Its beginning
was a modest one, and for some time the little
place existed in obscurity. Finally a club of bohemians
called the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hydropathie</span>” came over
from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quartier Latin</span> and made the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chat
Noir</span> their place of meeting.</p>

<p class='c000' >They organized weekly reunions where each
member of this jolly company recited original
verses or sang songs of his own composition.</p>

<p class='c000' >These reunions soon became open to the public,
and so the first singing cabaret of its kind
was created.</p>

<p class='c000' >The small room was filled with a collection of
bas-reliefs, busts and drawings, contributed by
its artist <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitués</span>. It offered nightly a shelter
to the budding genius of Bohemia and a place of
free license for patriotic and political songs,
satires, and parodies upon the current topics of
the day.</p>

<p class='c000' >And so the cabaret that Salis had started became
an acknowledged success.</p>

<p class='c000' >Later Salis moved the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chat Noir</span> to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue
Laval</span>, where it became an organized cabaret
with a regular staff of poets, singers, and satirists,
who made their appearance no longer in
public as amateurs but as professionals.</p>

<p class='c000' >Many of the lives of these <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansonniers</span></i> have
been varied and checkered with vicissitudes.
Few, if any, began either as singers or entertainers.
They have drifted into their profession
through their inherent love of a life steeped in the
atmosphere of Bohemia, where things original,
beautiful, satirical, or pathetic, find ever the keenest
appreciation and the shrewdest criticism.</p>

<p class='c000' >The various occupations to which Fate had so
cruelly destined these bohemians with the sacred
fire of art burning unceasingly within their
breasts, could not long be borne with patience.
Many had been doomed by practical and unsympathetic
parents to become bank clerks, merchants,
accountants in gas companies, engineers
or architects. All of these sordid careers were
regarded as an unbearable present and an impossible
future by inspired bards whose lyres
were tuned to a higher key than the humdrum of
business.</p>

<p class='c000' >Within these singing poets the sacred fire of
genius smoldered, but not for long. Like a live
coal in the ashes it burst into gentle flame when
breathed on by approbation. Soon the flicker
became a blaze of glory; the names of those who
had left their distasteful situations in the commercial
world were heralded with praise by thousands.</p>

<p class='c000' >These bards of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span> thenceforth consecrated
the remainder of their lives to the Muses.
Nightly they sang to the listening throng. All
of intellectual Paris came to applaud them, and
their stuffy little cabaret of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chat Noir</span>
was jammed nightly to the doors.</p>

<p class='c000' >Salis by the advice of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Emile Goudeau</span> published
a paper called the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chat Noir</span>,” in which appeared
sketches and poems of authors like
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Armand Masson, Rollinat, Haraucourt</span>, and other
members of the club, illustrated by now celebrated
artists, such as Steinlen, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Caran d’Ache, Henri
Rivière</span>, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Willette</span>, with drawings and cartoons
in an original style hitherto unknown.</p>

<p class='c000' >In 1885 Salis moved the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chat Noir</span> to the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue Victor Massé</span>. The cabaret was redecorated
with rare taste and became a popular rendezvous
for the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haut monde</span></i>. So great was the
crush that the club was forced to place a guardian
before the door and permit only twenty persons
to enter at a time.</p>

<p class='c000' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Henry Somm</span> organized the first theatrical
performance given at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chat Noir</span>. Before
this there had been only the performances of
singers and satirists.</p>

<p class='c000' >Somm erected a Punch and Judy where he
played a burlesque of his own, entitled “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Berline
de l’Emigré</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000' >The performance was found to be much too
short. To lengthen it, the painter <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Henri Rivière</span>
stretched a napkin over the toy proscenium and
passed in defile a procession of policemen cut in
cardboard and silhouetted in shadow against
the napkin. As the cardboard policemen advanced
in file, Jules Jouy sang his popular satire
on the police entitled, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Sergots</span>.”</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c000' >This was the beginning of the shadow shows
which made for years the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chat Noir</span> famous.
Here appeared the famous creations of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rivière</span>
and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Flagerolle</span>, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">March à l’Etoile</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’Enfant
Prodigue</span>.</p>

<p class='c000' >Later an ingenious shadow stage with intricate
mechanism was installed and a series of
shadow plays followed. Many of the puppets
for these exist to-day in the cabaret of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quat-Z’Arts</span>,
some of which are the work of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Caran
d’Ache</span>.</p>

<p class='c000' >Much of what once made the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chat Noir</span> famous
exists to-day in the best known of all the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmartrois</span></i>
cabarets, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quat-Z’Arts</span>. Here sing
the best of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansonniers</span></i>, and there is seldom
a night when the back room of the cabaret
in which this “smoker” occurs is not obliged
to close its doors because there is literally no
place for one more chair. The accompanist at
the piano has hardly room for his elbows, and the
singer just enough space to stand in. The walls
of the low-ceiled room are hung with the inimitable
caricatures by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Léandre</span> and with sketches
by celebrated artists.</p>

<p class='c000' >The front room by which you enter and which
is used as a café is a picturesque interior filled
with busts and bas-reliefs, and more of Léandre’s
clever drawings.</p>

<p class='c000' >A rustic stairway leads to a rambling gallery
above.</p>

<p class='c000' >The whole resembles the interior of some
quaint, half-timbered tavern filled with artistic
productions of men of genius. The interior of
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quat-Z’Arts</span> was not made to order; it grew,
and it walls are hung with souvenirs gathered
from its <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clientèle</span> of comrades whose work as
sculptors and draftsmen is known the world
over.</p>

<p class='c000' >The singers whose songs and satires have
made the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quat-Z’Arts</span> famous are men of rare
genius and fine intellect, and by no means the
idle bohemians you might expect to find.</p>

<p class='c000' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dominique Bonnaud</span> is such a man. As a singing
satirist, a polished writer and the most subtle
of humorists, he stands preeminent. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonnaud</span>
was at one time secretary to Prince Bonaparte,
and in eleven years of travel made several voyages
around the world. His experiences at foreign
courts and among foreign potentates have
supplied him with themes for many of his satires.
These deal with politics and current topics, and
hit at nobility in general and some noblemen in
particular.</p>

<p class='c000' >To the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansonnier</span></i> <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jean Bataille</span> is due an interesting
revival of the old songs of France.
Songs like “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Curé</span>” and the “French
Grenadier” Bataille sings with rare charm.
He is essentially an entertainer, and outside of
his nightly appearance at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quat-Z’Arts</span> has
made a success in several <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revues</span></i> of his own invention.
In these he has played at regular theaters,
the Mathurins and the Capucines. There
is nothing of the type of a bohemian singer in
the personality of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Bataille</span>. This
polished man of the world passed through a brilliant
career as a member of the bar and was at
one time secretary to the Minister of Interior.</p>

<p class='c000' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Georges Tiercy</span> is not only a singer but the
most inimitable of comedians. His creations
are unique. Sometimes he requires the accompaniment
of the piano, and sometimes he does
not, but, whichever way it is, he keeps his audience
at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quat-Z’Arts</span> in roars of laughter.</p>

<p class='c000' >It is Tiercy who sings his “Banquet to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur
Loubet</span>,” “The Humbert Family,” and
the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Train de Marchandises</span>,” the latter ending
with an imitation of grand opera which I
can assure you is quite as complete as the grand
opera itself and five times as amusing. “Come
and see me,” said Tiercy one day as we sat chatting
in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quat-Z’Arts</span>. He opened his wide
gray eyes at me and passed his hand thoughtfully
over his short-cropped forehead. Then he
added in a hoarse whisper:</p>

<p class='c000' >“I live in a forest! It is at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bois Colombes</span>.
Ah! my friend, you shall see a little house at the
very edge of the real country. Come out and
have a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit verre</span></i> with me.” Then he frowned as
he took out his watch and hurriedly left me to
catch his train.</p>

<p class='c000' >A few days later I went out to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bois</span> Colombes
to see him. The place did not look very woodsy
as I got out of the train. There were no dark
fastnesses or wild ravines; in fact, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bois</span> Colombes
was, if anything, sadly lacking in verdure.
The town itself was quite a practical
little place built up with modern houses.</p>

<p class='c000' >Finally I came to the villa of my friend, the
last of a pretty group of houses enclosed by a
hedge. The author of the “Train de Marchandises”
came out to greet me. He seemed worried
and preoccupied and explained to me he
was much fatigued, having just returned from a
hard journey to Brussels where he had sung
the day before.</p>

<p class='c000' >“And where is the forest?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Ah!” he replied, as if saving a surprise,
“you shall see. Come into the house and we
will have a bottle of stout.”</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c000' >I found the home of this serious humorist filled
with interesting souvenirs of his life as a comedian
and a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansonnier</span></i>, and we sat chatting until
late. My friend with the mysterious air told me
many interesting incidents of his career which,
in its early days, was one of mingled failure and
success. Having played for many years in
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revues</span></i> and operettas, Tiercy founded in 1893 his
cabaret, the Carillon, where, with his creations,
“The Clown Badaboum” and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Opéra Maboul</span>,”
he achieved a triumph—“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a succés fou</span></i>!”</p>

<p class='c000' >The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Carillon</span> failed after a short existence,
for this man of humor, this generous son of Bohemia,
was unsuited to the ways of close-fisted
managers. Tiercy lost twenty thousand francs
in the enterprise. He went back to his profession
and sang in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sans-Souci</span>. Since then he
has been a success as a mimic in nearly all the
cabarets of Montmartre and the Latin Quarter.</p>

<p class='c000' >“And now,” said my host seriously, “a
glimpse at my woodland.” He opened the curtains
of his sanctum. A spare group of trees
hardly hid the next villa from view.</p>

<p class='c000' >“My friend,” I said, “it is as you say, a veritable
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pays sauvage</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c000' >And I hurried for my train with Tiercy’s laugh
ringing in my ears.</p>

<p class='c000' >While the back room of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quat-Z’Arts</span> is
crowded nightly, the front room is filled with bohemian
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitués</span>; groups of painters, poets, and
musicians sit chatting at the tables, some of
them writing, others playing cards or dominoes.</p>

<p class='c000' >In one corner Bonnaud, having finished his
song, is engrossed in a manuscript. At another
table a poet singer is correcting the verses of a
new song with a fellow bard.</p>

<p class='c000' >Next to these a girl, quite as <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montmartroise</span></i>
as Marcelle, is in earnest conversation with a
“type” in a black broad-brimmed hat and a
stock wound about his throat. Perhaps it is the
beginning of a romance, more likely the aftermath
of an ended one. The girl had been
crying.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Toujours l’amour!</span></i>” mutters an old bohemian
in a rusty velvet coat, as he glances from his
corner at the pair. He trickles a little fresh
water into his absinthe and bends again over his
writing.</p>

<p class='c000' >The door opens and the singer, Gabriel Montoya,
enters, hastily shaking hands with those
about him and rushing to the back room, where
his arrival is greeted with thunderous applause.</p>

<p class='c000' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span> Montoya’s poetic locks that crown
his noble brow are mussed as if he had just escaped
from a panic. He is invariably introduced
as “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Docteur</span>” to his audience, his
early life having been devoted to the study of
medicine. He is a man of wide experience, having
at one time made a tour around most of the
world as a ship’s surgeon.</p>

<p class='c000' >In personality Montoya is a mixture of a
Chesterfield and the generous, open gallantry of
a Don Quixote. Together with these qualities
he possesses a tenor voice of rare charm. Besides
all this he is a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon garçon</span></i> and one of the
most popular <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansonniers</span></i> of Montmartre.</p>

<p class='c000' >At one time during his career his health broke
down and he was ordered south. Here he remained
for some time away from Paris, and the
report was current of his death. He was eulogized
in several lengthy obituaries by leading
journalists. These he had the rare opportunity
of reading. During his convalescence he wrote
“The Posthumous Author” and “The Verses
of One who did not Die.” He took his degree of
medicine in Montpellier. Hardly twenty-four
hours after passing his degree he came across
some of his old comrades from Montmartre in
the street, who were then making a concert tour
in the south of France. Their joy at seeing
their old friend risen, as it were, from the grave,
knew no bounds, and they insisted upon his accompanying
them. This he did, abandoning his
career of medicine to sing again.</p>

<p>A CABARET OF MONTMARTRE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >He made his début at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chat Noir</span> in 1890.
It was there that an incident occurred which
illustrates Montoya’s remarkable memory.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Phryné</span>,” the shadow play by Maurice
Donnay, was performing when its author became
involved in a duel with Catulle Mendes. Donnay
was wounded, and therefore he was unable to
return to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chat Noir</span> to recite the play. Salis
in this extremity turned to Montoya for aid. The
latter in one afternoon learned the twelve hundred
lines of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Phryné</span>” and recited them the
same evening without a mistake.</p>

<p class='c000' >To <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Paul Delmet</span> Paris owes many of her popular
songs. This veteran <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansonnier</span></i> has composed
volumes of exquisite ballads, parodies and
satires. His songs, such as “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Stances à Manon</span>,”
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brunette aux Yeux Doux</span>,” and his amusing
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Escalier</span>,” every Parisian knows. They are
sung everywhere.</p>

<p class='c000' >The late <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansonnier</span></i>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aristide Bruant</span>, was as
extravagant and impractical as the great
Balzac. He lived like a prince through good
and bad luck in his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">château</span> outside of Paris,
and, dressed in black velvet, drove daily to and
from his cabaret in Montmartre in a smart
turnout. De Bercy, his friend, tells the following
anecdote of Bruant:</p>

<p class='c000' >He came banging at De Bercy’s door early
one morning. “I have just been chosen as a
candidate for election at Belleville Saint Fargeau,”
cried Bruant excitedly, waking up the
sleepy De Bercy. “Get into your clothes in a
gallop; you will have to make my speech for me
and we have just time to catch the train. We
will breakfast at Belleville. I have accepted an
invitation for both of us. We’ll breakfast first
and you will have time to write your speech
afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c000' >Bruant could sing all night, but speech-making
was not in his line.</p>

<p class='c000' >The two hurried to Belleville and breakfasted,
and afterwards De Bercy wrote madly for three
hours and finished the address. Bruant knew
that if he would ingratiate himself in the hearts
of the Bellevillians he must do so by expressions
indicating his sympathy with the current wrongs
of the community. He must touch upon the
rights of the widows and orphans, the wrongs of
the working man, and other kindred topics.</p>

<p class='c000' >It happened that Bruant had in his repertoire
a lot of songs upon these very topics, none of
which the good people of Belleville had ever
heard.</p>

<p class='c000' >The hour arrived and before a large and enthusiastic
audience De Bercy launched into his
speech. Each time he finished a portion of his
discourse upon the widows or orphans, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bruant</span>
would burst into a song relative to the subject.
He had one ready upon every question upon
which his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confrère</span> spoke. The Bellevillians
cheered and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bruant</span> was elected by an overwhelming
majority amid a furor of good-fellowship
and an outpouring of the red wine of Belleville
Saint Fargeau!</p>

<p class='c000' >The “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Treteau de Tabarin</span>,” familiarly known
as the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boîte à Fursy</span>,” is a unique mixture of
cabaret and theater in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue Pigalle</span>. Its owner
and manager, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Henri Fursy</span>, is the author of the
celebrated “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chansons Rosses</span>.” These rough
and ready satires are sparkling with wit. To
invent a new type of songs is the achievement of
an epoch, and this is what <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fursy</span> has done. He
tells me he is not a poet, that his rhymes are
often very poor.</p>

<p class='c000' >“My style is not always good,” he said to me;
“my songs are satires written upon the spur of
the moment, and precisely in this crude state I
present them to the public. If I worked over
them they would lose much of their freshness.”</p>

<p class='c000' >There is nothing of the bohemian <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansonnier</span></i>
in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Fursy</span>. He is a dapper, smartly
dressed, alert, courteous, clean-cut man of business.
By his wits, push and energy, he has
made a success of his theater.</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c000' >Perhaps he has seen too much of the Parisian
method of transacting a business deal. This
consists in taking four weeks to think about the
proposition, several more of leisurely indecision,
and a corresponding length of time to settle the
matter. The Frenchman is astonished if in the
meantime some other fellow with a little Anglo-Saxon
hustle in him has seized the opportunity
and signed the contract.</p>

<p class='c000' >The quaint, rambling, half-timbered interior of
the foyer to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boîte à Fursy</span> is exceedingly
picturesque. Rare drawings and etchings line
the walls. The foyer has an ancient air about it
of having been used as a hostelry during the
Middle Ages. The walls are done in rough
plaster and quartered beams. In one corner a
primitive staircase leads to a rambling gallery,
and the audience passes into the quaint auditorium
through rough wooden doors running under
a low rustic shed.</p>

<p class='c000' >All of smart Paris goes to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boîte à Fursy</span>.
It is the smallest and one of the most expensive
theaters in Paris, but the performance upon the
small stage is sparkling with wit from beginning
to end. Here short satirical <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revues</span></i> are given by
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fursy</span> and other famous <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansonniers</span></i>, with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Odette
Dulac</span> in the principal rôle.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>ODETTE DULAC</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c000' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle Dulac</span> is Parisian from the butterfly
in her cadmium orange hair to the points
of her satin slippers. This inimitable artiste is
made up of two parts deviltry and one part
champagne. She handles the most risqué situations
with a delicious delicacy, humor, and the
tact of a finished comedienne. She is the life of
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i> at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boîte à Fursy</span>. If you have
heard <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Odette Dulac</span> sing “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je Suis Bête</span>,” in long
years to come the memory of it will serve to lift
you out of the blues. You will recall the daintiness
of this piquant and chic <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">divette</span></i>, her silk
stockings, her frou-frou skirt, the glitter of her
bodice, and the irresistible merriness of her
eyes as she winked at you over the tip of her
impudent little nose.</p>

<p class='c000' >But all this is the art of the comedienne.
At her home I found <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle Dulac</span> a
very gracious and charming woman, unspoiled
by the applause that nightly rings in her little
ears.</p>

<p class='c000' >It took the genius of Capiello to caricature
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Odette Dulac</span> and to give in a few clever lines all
of this amusing artiste’s personality. When
Dulac laughs, her eyes close like tiny half-moons
through which the pupils sparkle—very small
windows to a big merry soul.</p>

<p class='c000' >There are some women who never seem to
grow old and to whom youth seems ever constant.
To be merry yourself and to make others
merry is surely one secret of keeping young.</p>

<p class='c000' >The homes of artists of the Parisian stage
differ from the domiciles of others in the artistic
world. The tumbled rattle-trap of a dusty
studio does not appeal to great actors or divas.
The homes of many of the latter are models of
luxury and cleanliness.</p>

<p class='c000' >Much of the perfection of the Parisian actress’s
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ménage</span></i> is due to her faithful <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne</span>, who is companion,
cook, waitress, lady’s maid, and who, in
a thousand ways, protects and watches over the
interests of her mistress.</p>

<p class='c000' >Perhaps the most typical cabaret audience is
that in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Noctambules</span>,” in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue Champollion</span>.
It is an unpretentious little place of the
old type, where nightly appear some of the best
singers of Montmartre: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tiercy</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montoya</span>,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charles Fallot, Paul Delmet, Bréville, Marinier</span>
and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Laurence Deschamps</span>. The last
is an artiste of rare charm, who possesses a
voice sweet, pure and flexible, and whose interpretation
of scores of exquisite <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ballades</span></i> and
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">berceuses</span></i> have won for her the truest of all
criticism: sincere applause. But I must not forget
the veteran of them all, the bard of bards,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marcel Legay</span>.</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c000' >When you hear Legay you will have heard an
artist whose stirring songs, like his “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon
Cheval</span>” and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Pieds Devant</span>,” create a
furor wherever he sings them. Legay has a
faculty of making you feel the roar of battle. He
sings with fire and virility, and his personality
fills the room.</p>

<p class='c000' >In many of the cabarets it is the custom to
give gala <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matinées</span> and gala evenings with more
celebrities than usual on the program. A grand
tombola or lottery takes place at the close of the
performance, the receipts being given as a
testimonial benefit to one of the singers. It is
needless to say the prizes offered by these good
bohemians were purchased for as little as possible:
a two-franc bottle of champagne, their own
posters tied up with a ribbon, copies of their
songs, etc., etc. Yet the rollicking spirit in
which these things are praised by the poet
auctioneers, and the fact that the proceeds are
doing good to one of their number in need,
amply repay the loss to one’s pocket.</p>

<p class='c000' >Besides these gala <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matinées</span>, classic evenings
are given, classic poems are read, and the ancient
songs of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Provence</span> and ballads of the sixteenth
century are sung by the same <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansonniers</span></i> who
the night before may have amused you with the
“Voyage of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Humbert</span>” and other parodies.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>THE POET JEHAN RICTUS</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c000' >The poet Jehan Rictus has been known for
years in the cabarets of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span> and in those
of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rive gauche</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000' >Pale, lean and stooping, as he rises to speak
he resembles some sad, nocturnal crane. He
seems like one who nursed his melancholy and
lived during his waking hours in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c000' >As a young man he descended nightly from the
heights of Montmartre, where he lived, to join a
circle of bohemians at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cabaret de la Bosse</span>.
Here he came into recognition by the recitations
of his poems and soliloquies.</p>

<p class='c000' >The verses of Rictus dwell in misanthropic
bitterness upon the misery of poverty. They
are filled with the soliloquies of a pessimist and a
misanthrope. The bitter misery of his earlier
years through which he was forced to struggle,
has no doubt taken the sunlight out of his heart,
and yet beneath the varnish of a crude and bourgeois
vocabulary lies the timber of true genius.
What if the grain is fantastically distorted by a
weird imagination! It is prized all the more by
the connoisseurs.</p>

<p class='c000' >Another veteran of the cabarets is Louise
France.</p>

<p class='c000' >There is something suggestive of old Paris in
this short, squat woman with her puffy haggard
face and her tangled hair.</p>

<p class='c000' >In the days of the Terror just such a one
might have headed a mob gathered by her
songs and her verses. It requires very little
make-up to transform Louise France into her
rôle of Frochard in “The Two Orphans” or
into “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eva la Tomate</span>” in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle Fifi</span>.”
Paris has not yet forgotten her famous characterization
of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concierge</span></i> in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Voix du
Peuple</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Louise France</span> has played at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre
Libre</span>, at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Porte St. Martin</span>, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grand
Guignol</span>, the characters <em>she knew</em>, and she played
them to the life with wonderful skill.</p>

<p class='c000' >Later she abandoned the stage to become editor
of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Fronde</span>.” She has written many parodies,
this <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gamine</span></i>, this <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne femme</span></i>; many of her verses
are in the memory to-day of thousands.</p>

<p class='c000' >Later in life she came as a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansonnière</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">récitateuse</span></i>
to the cabarets. It was at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eugénie Buffet</span>’s
cabaret “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Purée</span>” that I heard her recite
her verses.</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c000' >Many of these her brain had created years ago,
before her gray hairs came. Some were new
and all of them were true. Within the heart of
Louise France lie tenderness and pity. Hear
her recite “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Grues</span>,” and you will realize
how human she is and how much she knows of
life and forgives.</p>

<p class='c000' >To-day she seems happy among her old comrades
in Bohemia whom she has been with so
many years.</p>

<p class='c000' >Dear old soul, would that the whole world had
been as human and understanding as you, and as
free from meanness, pettiness, and the haggling
over that which in the end counts for naught!
All through your life your brain has been busy
producing much that is beautiful and pure. Come,
then, give us “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Petits Soldats</span>,” we will listen
quietly to the very end. Some of us, I fear,
will cry, and when your song is ended, all of us
will give you a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">double-ban</span></i> of applause and drink
your health.</p>

<p class='c000' >To <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pierre Trimouillat</span> is due a whole volume
of clever parodies and satires. He is a modest
little man with no enemies and a host of friends
who know that back of his satires lies kindly
good-fellowship. From year to year, ever
since his success as a singing satirist was assured
among the founders of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chat Noir</span>,”
he has sung in a quiet voice the words which his
satirical wit has invented.</p>

he looks much more like a big, blustering,
gallant cavalry officer, and this is precisely what

<p class='c000' >It is <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Privas</span> who wrote the delicate fantasy full

<p>THE CONCERT ROUGE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansonnier</span></i> of to-day in Montmartre is not
the velvet-coated, long-haired poet that one
could have seen two score of years ago, muffled
in his cloak, with his verses beneath his arm,
wending his way to some cozy corner of this Bohemia
to join his fellow poets and recite his
couplets, returning to his garret singing at the
break of dawn. Those were the poet-singers of
the time of Henri Murger.</p>

<p class='c000' >To-day the cabarets of Montmartre are regarded
for the most part as purely business
ventures, and it is the ambition of many of these
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansonniers</span></i> to own and direct their own cabaret,
make their fortune, and retire in comfort before
old age. Many of them are married men with
families to support. There is every inducement
for them to lead domestic lives. Singing night
after night in the smoke and often vitiated air of
the cabarets is fatiguing work.</p>

<p class='c000' >Even the best <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansonniers</span></i> are paid but little
for their work. Ten francs a night is the regular
price, and many women sing for less.</p>

<p class='c000' >The price charged for admission varies from
one franc and a half up to three francs, which
sum includes your drink. The seating capacity
of these cabarets is limited, and the profits are
in proportion. These low salaries are not confined
to the cabarets alone.</p>

<p class='c000' >There are women whose names appear in
startling big letters on the bills of concert-halls
who get nine francs a night for a turn of three
songs with encores and three <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matinées</span> a week,
not including extra performances on <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span> days.</p>

<p class='c000' >Out of this they are obliged to provide effective
gowns, and these must be replaced by fresher
ones before they become too familiar to the
audience. Besides, the singers are obliged to
pay their dresser, for few can afford a maid, and
the dressing-room attendant and the hair-dresser
attached to the establishment. They
must even pay for the orchestration of their
songs, and for their own posters. Many of
these women are well supported, but there are
many more to whom an honest life is a hopeless
struggle for existence.</p>

<p class='c000' >Should they accept a position in the big cafés-concerts
like those of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Champs-Élysées</span>,
they will be paid more for their services, but the
expenses extorted from them will be increased
in proportion.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Did you walk again to-day, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle
D.</span>?” asked a manager of a leading open-air
music-hall of one of his most attractive artistes.
“You know it does not look well for you to be
seen arriving on foot.”</p>

<p class='c000' >His manner was polite, but his tone suggested
to this hard-working little singer, “Forever after
at least a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiacre</span></i>!”</p>

<p class='c000' >A few days later he continued:</p>

<p class='c000' >“Don’t you think you had better put on a new
gown, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mademoiselle</span>? The public gets tired of
seeing the same dresses.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“But, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>, that is the third one I have
had in six weeks and I can not manage, with my
salary, to have a new gown every week.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“Well, then,” said the manager, “let me arrange
matters for you. You please the public
and I am ready to make as fair a proposition to
you as I do to the others. I will give you an engagement
for three seasons on the condition
that you shall dine at least three nights a week
in the restaurant upstairs.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span>,” answered <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mademoiselle</span>, indignantly,
“when that becomes my <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">métier</span></i>, I shall
manage it myself.”</p>

<p class='c000' >Among the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bons garçons</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">braves filles</span></i> of the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vie de Bohème</span></i>, on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span>, this good <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parisienne</span>
would have been held in respect and esteem.</p>

<p class='c000' >There are few marriages among these bohemians
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Butte</span>, but love they hold sacred,
and woman as the ideal of all creation. Among
scores of these <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits ménages</span></i> exist peace, happiness
and fidelity. Many are the most domestic
of homes. Sometimes these <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bons garçons</span></i> and

really did in the end, beneath the trembling

speaks of it as of some unusual incident in

Fifteen years ago all of idle
Paris applauded “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Goulue</span>,”
a can-can <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">danseuse</span></i> whose beauty
and abandon made her notorious.
In every sense of the term
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Goulue</span>” was of the kind
of quadrille dancers which were
to be found at the old Mabille when it was at
the height of its blaze and glory.</p>

<p class='c000' >She had jewels in those days, and lingerie of
Valenciennes lace. She was the incarnation of
all that was reckless and extravagant. She elevated
her toes where she pleased, tipping off the
silk hats of the well-fed old <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roués</span></i> who chanced
to crowd too near the magic circle while she
danced.</p>

<p class='c000' >She had a ready wit, too, and a vocabulary interlarded
with the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">argot</span></i> of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gamine</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gigolette</span></i>
of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">barrière</span></i>. All of leisure Paris patted
her approvingly upon her bare shoulders and
threw her their louis. But those were the
days when <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Goulue</span> was younger. Now time
has flown away with youth, her fervor and her
grace.</p>

<p class='c000' >She became stout—almost portly. One blue
Monday this famous <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">danseuse</span></i> packed up her frills
and her furbelows, folded carefully what was left
of her Valenciennes lace, and said good-by to
her old-time <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">métier</span></i>. It was a little sad—for La
Goulue loved to dance.</p>

<p class='c000' >She took another step in her career, perhaps
the most daring and the most dangerous of all.
She became a lion tamer, bought from a stranded
menagerie some green “cat stock,” to use
the vernacular of the circus world, moved from
her Parisian residence to a wagon on wheels,
and so became sole proprietor, manager and
trainer of an animal show in a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête foraine</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000' >In the dull season I found <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Goulue</span> in February
beyond the fortifications of Paris, where in
addition to her gipsy wagon on wheels she kept
in her back yard screened from the curious eyes
of the town children half a dozen cages—the
cramped homes of four lions, one laughing
hyena, two slinking panthers and a sad-looking
bear.</p>

<p class='c000' >The roof of her salon on wheels was interesting.
The ribs supporting the ceiling were
decorated with narrow fringe which had evidently
served at one time to trim some circus
paraphernalia. A bunk spanned one end of the
barrack, and several trunks containing <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Goulue</span>’s
effects occupied most of the remaining floor
space.</p>

<p class='c000' >It was a sunny morning, and a black and white
kitten lay on its back upon the tumbled quilts of
the bunk, playing with its tail, the tip of which
the sunbeams streaming through the little
square window over the bunk occasionally illumined.</p>

<p class='c000' >Some cauliflower simmered on the stove for
dinner.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i_224.jpg' alt='' class='ig024' />
</div>

<p class='c000' >In another corner
sat “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur La
Goulue</span>,” the
lion tamer. He
is a man about
forty, tall, well-built,
blond, with a
determined jaw,
and cool and
collected in his
manner, as befits
his profession.
He wore a blue flannel shirt, water-proof
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sabots</span></i>, and four diamond rings.</p>

<p class='c000' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Goulue</span> unearthed for me from the bottom
of a trunk some of her past glory: a set of photographs
taken by a smart photographer during
the time of her favor, and a framed certificate
of a first prize for dancing bearing the date 1889,
and the seal of the judges of the award.</p>

<p class='c000' >She also brought to light a contract to dance
for three thousand seven hundred and fifty
francs a week. The document bore the signature
of a notary and the stamp of the French
government.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i_225.jpg' alt='' class='ig025' />
</div>

<p class='c000' >Meanwhile the lions in
the fourth cage roared,
and the sad bear, made
happy with
his morning
ration
of mush
and milk,
buried his nose in the pail, muzzle and all, and
forgave his mistress for changing her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">métier</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000' >Next to the panthers’ cage the week’s wash
hung drying in the sun. Some of it was coquettish.</p>

<p class='c000' >Ah! my friend, if you complain of the responsibility
of having a family on your hands, remember
it is not a patch to having a menagerie on your
hands, even without the cumbersome elephant.</p>

<p class='c000' >“To show” inside the fortifications costs
dearly—six hundred francs rental for a place in
any of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fêtes foraines</span></i>. The law prohibits
single exhibitions which are not a part of the
regular <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fêtes foraines</span></i>, and these take place only
at stated intervals in the different quarters of
the city. They are the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Foire aux Pain-d’Epices</span>,
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fête de Neuilly</span>, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fête des Invalides</span>, the
one surrounding the bronze lion of Belfort, and
other smaller ones along the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boulevards Vaugirard,
Pasteur, Garibaldi, Grenelle</span>, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rochechouart</span>,
and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fête of La Chapelle</span>. The
still smaller <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fêtes</span> outside of Paris do not pay
well. Meanwhile the animals have to be fed,
pay or no pay.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>BEHIND THE SCENES</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c000' >“There are those who have said hard things
of me even in the old days,” said <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Goulue</span>,
“but they lied. I am a good girl with a good
heart (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je suis une bonne fille</span></i>),” she cried, looking
me straight in the eye. “It was the life that
was bad, not I, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000' >There is great risk to life and limb in training
and showing these animals; the lion Bob a
while ago closed his jaws upon “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. La Goulue</span>,”
crunching half through the shoulder. Yet it is
the injury to others that the Goulues fear the
most.</p>

<p class='c000' >One of the panthers tore the arm from a child
during a performance in Rouen. It was an expensive
accident for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Goulue</span>.</p>

<p class='c000' >At the time I saw this small menagerie wintering
in a corner of the earth, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Goulue</span> was
waiting for an engagement in a coming <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête
foraine</span></i>. As yet the letter had not arrived, and I
believe the bear knew it.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. La Goulue</span>” did not smile, and spoke but
rarely. You felt his absolute domination and
fearlessness. He took the hyena by the throat,
then stroked its ears kindly. When he rolled
Alice, the lioness, over on her back, he did so
with gentleness and firmness; when she rebelled
and struck at him viciously, he cuffed her ears
and stood talking to her as to a disobedient
child.</p>

<p>ENTRANCE TO THE FÊTE DE NEUILLY</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >These exhibitions are of varied character.
Many of them are counterparts of those along
the “Bowery” of our own Coney Island, but
many spectacles may be witnessed inside the enclosures
of these claptrap barracks of canvas and
board that are wholly foreign to us. Their ornamental
façades are adorned with marvels of pictorial
art representing all manner of wonderful
things not found in this or any other clime.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic027'>
<img src='images/i_231.jpg' alt='' class='ig027' />
<p>A SUNDAY CROWD—FÊTE DE NEUILLY</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >Side-showing is a science. Some fakirs have
become rich with little more than a dirty red
curtain to screen from view the wonders promised
within, a good “barker” to heighten the
desire and imagination of the gaping crowd in
front, and a tame ape tied outside to attract the
little ones. That there was after all nothing
worth even two sous to behold behind the mysterious
portal, the spectators in front knew by
the sheepish smirk of those coming out, yet they
paid their sous just the same and filed in to see
what had fooled the other fellows!</p>

<p class='c000' >In the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fête de Neuilly</span> I did not find these
fake methods existing. It is a dangerous thing
to fool a French crowd, and so it is the custom
to parade upon an elevated platform at the entrance
in plain view of the passer-by the troupe
advertised to show within.</p>

<p class='c000' >There stand the girl in tights, the clown, the
juggler and the strong man, and the spectator
may judge fairly for himself whether he thinks it
worth while to part with his sous to know them
better. For one franc he may study their talent
from a kitchen chair, alluringly termed a “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fauteuil
d’orchestre</span></i>.” A bench seat generally within
a foot of it rents at half price, and a bleacher
seat at five sous, with a reduction to children
and the military.</p>

<p class='c000' >There are certain hours and special days when
the generous manager lowers even these prices—dinner
hours when the passing throng thins
out, and rainy days when the clown appears
in a mackintosh and the girl in the pink cotton
tights wraps a plush boa about her powdered
neck and wears the clown’s galoshes, while the
monkey at the end of his chain buries his head
out of the drip and falls asleep.</p>

<p>AN ANIMAL SHOW, FÊTE DE NEUILLY</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >One of the most popular shows of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fêtes
foraines</span></i> is that of the female wrestlers. Many of
these combatively inclined ladies cultivate a
pose that would put to the blush Hercules leaning
on his club. Some of them gird their loins
in imitation lion skins, others wear wristlets of
heavy leather “to protect them from the brutality
of their adversaries,” who, the manager
assures the interested crowd, are drawn from all
corners. So you will see a burly looking bourgeois
elbow his way through the crowd and
agree openly before the spectators to wrestle
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle Blanche</span> “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Tigresse</span>” through
three rounds, catch-as-catch-can. He tells the
manager he was trained by the great Marseille
himself and, giving his name and place of residence
in case of accident, enters the tent with
his candy-haired opponent. All the strong men
in these <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fêtes foraines</span></i> seem to have been trained
by Marseille!</p>

<p class='c000' >The two file into the amphitheater beyond
the curtain, while the manager roars outside exhorting
the crowd to follow.</p>

<p class='c000' >In the second round <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle Blanche</span>
has thrown her bourgeois fairly, while six other
lady wrestlers sit on the edge of the ring and
applaud. The crowd grows enthusiastic.</p>

<p class='c000' >In the third round the bourgeois by a neck-hold
slaps his adversary down on the platform,
squarely on her back. Both her shoulders
touch. The crowd cheers. The bourgeois has
won.</p>

<p class='c000' >The band in the corner pumps forth a mournful
waltz, and another wrestler prepares for the
second bout.</p>

<p class='c000' >When the show closes, the chance bourgeois
and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle Blanche</span> will return to their
home in one of the sea of shanties beyond the
barrier, and the manager will turn up his coat
collar, give a fresh rub to his silk hat, deposit
the contents of his tin cash-box in his wallet, and
hail a passing omnibus.</p>

<p class='c000' >The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fête de Neuilly</span> during the afternoon and
evening is alive throughout its length and
breadth with a vast throng of pleasure seekers
of all classes and conditions. Along the route
of attractions mammoth carrousels, gorgeous in
gilt and mirrors, swing round at a giddy pace,
filled with screaming, laughing women and their
escorts. Another form of carrousel is the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montagnes
Russes</span>,” with undulating circular tracks
over which gilded chariots rush to the accompaniment
of powerful steam calliopes.</p>

<p>A SALON OF MYSTERIES—FÊTE DE NEUILLY</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >Farther on are a row of swings. In one of
these sky-scraping affairs a chic little <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blanchisseuse</span></i>,
her blond hair flying beneath a soldier’s
cap jammed over her ears, is holding on tight
and screaming with laughter while her escort
the soldier pulls the rope with renewed effort,
until they both come near bumping their heads
on the upper supports.</p>

<p>THE MONTAGNES RUSSES—FÊTE DE NEUILLY</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >A few steps farther on, another merry-go-round
is on the point of starting. Astride of a
wooden camel sits a young negro wearing a
straw hat with a pink satin band, and a suit
known as “nobby.” Two girls pass. They are
evidently two little <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couturières</span></i> out for a holiday.
One of them, a little brunette, catches sight of
the coal black youth with the pink satin tie.
The two girls hold a hurried conversation. Suddenly
the little brunette runs up to the surprised
gentleman in the nobby suit, throws her arms
about his neck and kisses him.</p>

<div class='ic031'>
<img src='images/i_237.jpg' alt='' class='ig031' />
<p>A POPULAR MENAGERIE—FÊTE DE NEUILLY</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voilà</span></i>,” she says as she runs on to join her
companion, bubbling with laughter over the
joke.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je pourrai dire que j’ai embrassé un nègre!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c000' >At night the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fête de Neuilly</span> is ablaze with
light. Carriages crawl slowly through the
crowd, some of them are smart private turnouts
which have driven to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span> after dinner at Armononville
or elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000' >Parading side by side with these are others
containing jolly parties waving great paper
chrysanthemums and sunflowers carried upon
long sticks. These pretty souvenirs are sold by
the thousands in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span>, and nearly every party
of merrymakers brings them back to the boulevard
cafés.</p>

<p class='c000' >Among other attractions are circuses and menageries
where hourly exhibitions of animals in
training draw steady audiences. There is little
attempt to decorate the interior of these menageries—a
few kitchen chairs fronting a row of
cages and standing room back of these furnish
the necessary accommodation for the audience.
As a rule, the animals in these small shows are
well cared for and kept in unusually good condition.</p>

<p class='c000' >The name Pezon in France is traditionally
suggestive of the best animal show. Through
three generations the Pezons have been animal
trainers and maintained menageries throughout
France. There is not one of this intrepid family
who has not at some time been dragged bleeding
from beneath some infuriated beast. One of the
sons who still risks his life daily is minus an arm,
having been mangled by a lion a few years ago.</p>

<p>AN OPEN AIR CHILDREN’S SHOW</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >I saw one veteran trainer in the Pezon show
turn pale as he realized that an ugly lion he had
forced into a corner had become unmanageable
and blind with rage. Keepers ran to his help,
and most of the audience rose in a panic and
started to rush through the exit. The cage
rocked as the lion sprang from side to side and
the ground seemed to tremble beneath his snarling
roar, but the man within the bars held his
ground. He was a short, thick-set fellow with
blond hair. Step by step he forced the lion back
into its corner, and as firmly and slowly he conquered
him until the crouching beast who could
have killed him with a blow sprang panic-stricken
out of his way. Then the little man turned
to the audience, bowed with the air of a dancing-master
and sprang through the safety door.
Cheers of “Bravo!” rose from the audience
who had remained as if hypnotized; but the man
who had been so near death did not seem to notice
them, for he shrugged his shoulders and
smiled as if the episode were of little importance.
Lighting a cigarette, he disappeared
through a door in the rear.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic033'>
<img src='images/i_241.jpg' alt='' class='ig033' />
<p>A BALLOON ASCENSION</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >I once knew an old French trainer and owner
of a menagerie, Champeaux by name, who came
to grief in a different way. He was a jovial
old fellow and when he was not training lions,
hyenas, panthers, or bears, spent most of his time
over the flowing bowl in some nearby café, telling
stories and spreading the sunshine of geniality
among his old cronies. He had been in
the cages so much of his life and had such a host
of friends, in fact he was such a popular old fellow
and so jolly and genial withal, that I believe
he grew to think that the animals he
trained loved him too.</p>

<p class='c000' >At one time having installed his animal show
in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête foraine</span></i> at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place du Trone</span>, he
attended the wedding festivities of a friend. It
happened to be a bourgeois wedding, and the
bride and groom and their guests made merry
with champagne and congratulations in one of
those Parisian restaurants where the second
floor above the café is rented to wedding parties
and banquets. The festivities kept up until the
hour grew late. Champeaux was the most
hilariously happy of the guests. He embraced
the bride and groom and toasted the happy pair
in numerous bumpers, and at last proudly zigzagged
his way back to the menagerie. “All his
lions should hear what a good time he had had,”
he said to himself. As he reeled along, he imagined
that he was twenty-one and a bridegroom;
then somehow he dreamed that most of his lions
had grown wings and had pink fur on their paws
and that all his cages had turned to solid gold.</p>

<p>AT A FÊTE FORAINE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >And so he lurched on towards his pets, singing
a song of cheer. He reached his menagerie before
daylight. His keepers, snoring peacefully
in their bunks, did not hear him as he stumbled
in through a hole in the tent and proceeded to
the row of cages. A lioness, wakened out of
her sleep, recognized him, and pacing to the end
of her cage, peered out at him. He must have
presented a strange sight, for she roared twice,
half waking the other animals. Then my friend
did a foolish thing; he stumbled up the steps of
the trained bear’s cage, apologized to the steps
for tripping over them, slipped the spring latch
and entered the den. Taking his hat off politely
to the bear who, at his unexpected entrance,
rose on her hind legs, Champeaux fell into her
arms.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Pepita,” he said, “I have had a good time, a
good time, old girl,” and he slapped her enthusiastically
on her scrubby neck.</p>

<p class='c000' >Pepita squealed, embraced him in turn, as if in
sympathy, and looked at him queerly with her
small round eyes. Then Champeaux groaned—Pepita
had broken his ribs.</p>

<p class='c000' >In America the roof of the three-ring circus
holds a network of trap apparatus upon which a
dozen aerial performers exhibit at the same
time. In the first ring there is a bareback act,
in the second a juggling family upon an intermediate
stage, and in the third ring a herd of
trained elephants. Over the surrounding race-track
twenty clowns play tag, setting small sections
of the amphitheater into roars of laughter
as they pass.</p>

<p class='c000' >All this is typical with us of the “greatest
show on earth.”</p>

<p class='c000' >Parisians delight in the circus as much as we
do, but they are content in seeing one thing at a
time and enjoying it.</p>

<p class='c000' >Here the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cirques</span></i> are as cozy as theaters and
one small ring suffices. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nouveau Cirque</span>,
whose façade on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue St. Honoré</span> resembles
that of a music-hall, is the most comfortable of
all the Parisian circuses, and, like the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cirque
d’Hiver</span> and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cirque Médrano</span>, is open the
year round. The patronage of the last two is
more bourgeois than that of the first one, for
both are situated in thickly populated quarters.</p>

<p class='c000' >The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Médrano</span>, on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boulevard Rochechouart</span>
in Montmartre, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cirque d’Hiver</span>, on the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boulevard du Temple</span>, are patronized for the
most part by the people of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue du Temple</span>
and around <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la Place de la Bastille</span>.</p>

<p class='c000' >All Paris pours to Longchamp the day of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grand Prix</span>. Seen from the grandstand, the
track stretches away in a velvety green ribbon.
Every square foot of the remainder of the vast
enclosure is packed with people. Part of this
human sea, that which fills the grandstands and
broad promenade, is gay in the smartest of toilettes,
silk parasols, and shining top hats. The
rest is made up of all sorts and conditions.</p>

<p class='c000' >Indoor displays of horsemanship, where the
incentive of betting is lacking, have not been a
success in Paris—at least when conducted upon
a large scale. The old Hippodrome, founded
for track exhibitions, has passed out of existence.
It was too big to be popular, and the new Hippo-Palace,
a splendid structure forming a spacious
angle with the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue Calvalotti</span> and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue Caulincourt</span>,
after a short life proved an absolute failure.
Its exterior was vast and exceedingly attractive
in color. The whole was done in a
scheme of gold and turquoise blue velvet, with a
huge stage for ballets at the end of the three-ringed
amphitheater. The performance was
excellent, and for a while it looked as if the
Hippo-Palace might be a success. But the same
criticism caused its downfall. There were too
many things to watch at once from seats too far
removed from the performers.</p>

<p>THE CROWD AT LONGCHAMP</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >Parisians enjoy the intimacy of a small circus.</p>

<p class='c000' >Between the acts the pretty stables behind
the scenes are crowded with people who enjoy
looking at the horses in their neatly kept stalls—indeed,
many of these remain in the stables
after the bell announces the continuance of the
performance, in order to view at leisure the byplay
of the performers before they go into the
ring.</p>

<p class='c000' >A pretty bareback rider comes tripping down
the stairs from her dressing-room. Her horse is
brought out for her from its stall, and, while an
elderly gentleman with a ribbon in his buttonhole
stands chatting with her for a moment, her
groom gives a final cinch to the mare’s white kid
girdle and rosins its broad back.</p>

<p class='c000' >Applause announces the end of an act, and a
trained bear, held in check by his keeper, shuffles
past you.</p>

<p class='c000' >It is <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mademoiselle</span>’s turn now, and the old
gentleman with the decoration lifts his opera hat
as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mademoiselle</span> leaves him and runs into the
ring.</p>

<p class='c000' >From the circular <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">promenoir</span></i> behind the second
tier of boxes you catch glimpses of women in
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chic</span></i> toilets who nightly frequent the circuses.</p>

<p class='c000' >Immortal are the names of the famous of
French clowns—Boum-Boum, Auguste and
Chocolat. For years they have made Paris roar
with laughter, and the little French children
kick their bare legs in glee.</p>

<p class='c000' >Chocolat and Auguste, who appear together,
are far more than ordinary clowns. They are
past masters in the art of nonsense. Every
effect is carefully planned and studied. Their
performance is pantomime of the first order. To
keep the amused attention of an audience for
half an hour by a representation of Hamlet
played with no costumes and no scenery, and for
the most part executed wholly in pantomime,
requires rare skill and subtle humor, and that
rarest of qualities in comic men, the time to
know when to stop.</p>

<p class='c000' >There is something especially attractive in the
coziness of these one-ring circuses of Paris.
The buildings themselves are circular, like those
built for permanent panoramas. From the ring,
with its red velvet border, begin rows of orchestra
seats, reaching to the balcony of pretty boxes,
behind which is a circular promenade.</p>

<p>MADEMOISELLE LA BOUFFONNE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >The stables themselves are models of well-ordered
cleanliness, and each stall that contains
some beauty of the ring shines in polished brass.
The stall posts are bound with fresh sheaths of
straw tied with gaily colored ribbons.</p>

<p class='c000' >An attractive feature of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nouveau Cirque</span> is
the aquatic performance which concludes the
show. The big ring mattress is suspended between
two giant wheels and rolled away; the
floor of the ring sinks slowly, and water rushes
in until a safe diving depth is attained. Calcium
lights are turned upon this improvised lake, and
an aquatic burlesque follows. This naturally
concludes the program, for every one taking
part tumbles in as often as possible and retires
dripping to his dressing-room. One of these
farce comedies ends in a wedding party where
the bride and groom are ferried across in the
little boat. The clown who acts as ferryman is
invariably upset, and the wedding party have to
kick out and swim for shore, on which they climb
or are hauled minus most of their clothes.</p>

<p class='c000' >The Thursday <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matinées</span> are filled with happy
French children. What a never-to-be-forgotten
ecstasy it must be to Jacqueline, François and
little Antoinette to be taken between the acts
to the café of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cirque Médrano</span> and be served
with a huge <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cérise à l’eau</span></i> by the clown himself.
How delightful to hear his special jokes as he
pours out for them their <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cérise</span></i> and nearly spills
a whole trayful of cakes over their heads as he
serves it!</p>

<p>STREET CLOWNS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >I spent the afternoon yesterday with a famous
old clown at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Médrano</span>. At intervals during
our chat my friend would leave me to run back
into the ring and play the fool. Yet he was a
grave and a sad old man. His heavily chalked
face with its traditional black lines between his
eyes and his painted cheeks seemed strangely
incongruous as he talked seriously of his life.</p>

<p class='c000' >Behind his mask of chalk his old eyes burned
with a brave light in them still, for his life had
been one of trying struggle. He spoke of the
death of his only daughter, of the hardships of
many touring adventures in many lands.</p>

<p class='c000' >“I went with my family to Constantinople to
start a circus there, and it took me five years to
earn enough money to return, for we not only
lost all we had, but were forced into debt.</p>

<p class='c000' >“We managed to get free at last and returned
to Paris. Here we worked hard, all of us, and at
last we opened again a circus of our own. My
son-in-law was the trapeze performer, and my
boy was a clown like myself. We had with us a
family of old friends, the Lorettis—you may remember
them? The opening night of that show
brought with it the old sensation of ruin staring
us in the face. We opened the doors that evening
just thirty-five thousand francs in debt.
Gradually by hard work we managed to pull out
of it, and,” he added, “to-day, thank God! I am
free from worry and anxiety. I know that I can
make but a living at the best. I get my money
here; it is not much, but I get it regularly, and
here I shall stay. I am sixty years old and
have been a clown nearly forty years of my life.”</p>

<p class='c000' >He excused himself for a moment and ran out
into the ring, turned a flipflap, and ran tripping
over things in a fruitless endeavor to assist the
lady in pink tulle on her cantering white horse.
A pantomime followed in which a second clown,
his son, having killed him in a comic duel,
doubled his father up, packed him neatly in a
barrel, and wheelbarrowed him out of the ring.</p>

<p class='c000' >“You see,” continued the father seriously
as he rejoined me, having divested himself of
the barrel and run the wheelbarrow out of the
way of an advancing herd of elephants, “it is
different with your big American shows. An
artist there never gets credit for his work. With
so many acts going at once it is impossible for
him to be fairly seen. He can play only to a
small section of the house, and, if he is doing
high trap work like my son-in-law, he no sooner
gets a neat trick worked up than the bell rings
and down the rope he has to come.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Well, sir, I must wash up and be getting
along; we have dinner at home at six and I
have a little special marketing to do for we
have some old friends coming.”</p>

The stage of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Folies Bergère</span>
during a spectacular <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i> is a
busy place. Sunday evening is
always a crowded night at Parisian
theaters and a hard one
upon players, since all the theaters
on that day give <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matinées</span>
as well.</p>

<p class='c000' >There are few persons in
an audience who realize the
amount of hard work required
of every one behind the scenes in the staging
and playing of a spectacular <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000' >It was nine o’clock Sunday evening and the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i> at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Folies Bergère</span> was about to begin,
as my friend, a successful writer of many Parisian
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revues</span></i>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur René Louis</span>, led me
through the crowded <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">promenoir</span></i> of this thoroughly
Parisian music-hall and through a small iron
door into another world. I say another world,
for it was peopled with fairies—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coryphées</span></i> in
pink tights whose eyes were stenciled and lined
with blue until they appeared as almond-shaped
as an odalisque’s. The stage was crowded with
scene-shifters in black caps and long white
linen dusters, with ladies protected from stray
drafts by warm woolen dressing gowns, with
hair-dressers in their shirt-sleeves, with firemen
in shining brass helmets, with ballet girls in
white tulle and fleshings, and pink satin slippers
with padded toes.</p>

<p class='c000' >We came upon all this suddenly, for, as we
entered the iron door leading to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coulisses</span></i>, we
found ourselves in a small <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entresol</span></i> and in the
midst of a dozen <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coryphées</span></i> who were giving a
final touch to their make-up before an extra
mirror.</p>

<p class='c000' >The air was heavy with the odor of scores of
different cheap perfumes.</p>

<p class='c000' >Down a narrow winding stairway leading from
the dressing-rooms above, poured a stream of
other <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coryphées</span></i>, principals, ballet girls and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">figurantes</span></i>,
a moving kaleidoscopic procession of pink
tights, glittering tinsel and bizarre head-dresses.</p>

<p class='c000' >Groups of chorus girls gossiped in safe corners
out of the way of hurrying scene-shifters.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Attention! s’il vous plait</span></i>,” shouted two of the
latter as they dodged past with a section of a
Venetian palace, while two others followed with
half of the Bridge of Sighs and eight feet of canvas
water.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dis donc, ma chérie</span></i>,” said a petite brunette
costumed as a gray pigeon to another pigeon
whose dresser was attaching to her shoulders a
pair of white wings, “did you find the tailor
whose address I gave you yesterday? A hundred
francs for a dress like my little brown one,
and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tu sais trés, trés chic</span></i>. Tell Amélie I am coming
to see her to-morrow <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à trois heures, n’est-ce pas</span></i>?”
and the gray pigeon hurried away to her place
in the wings.</p>

<p class='c000' >High up above the busy stage hung the great
drops suspended from a network of ropes.
Hoisted by the side of an Italian lake hung the
back flat of the palace of diamonds, and next
to it a dark wood through which at ten thirty-five,
by the stage manager’s watch, fluttered
nightly a ballet of bats.</p>

<p class='c000' >My friend led the way through a back corridor
to the director’s office. I found the director a
serious man of affairs, who looked more like a
scientist than a man of the theater. His greeting
was most cordial, even hospitable, for, as he
left me to attend to the performance, he added,
with charming courtesy: “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur, vous êtes ici
chez vous</span></i>; go where you will or, better still, let
me present you to our stage manager. It is he
who is really captain of the ship in the storm,
for we have some rapid dark changes to make
during the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i>, when you will be safer in a
corner.”</p>

<p class='c000' >From the wings behind the blaze of the footlights,
the crowded house lay like a flower-garden
in the dusk. Here a patch of red flamed
brighter than the rest from some theater hat;
there the white of a shirt-front gleamed.</p>

<p class='c000' >The prompter sat huddled under his wooden
hood with his prompt-book in readiness for the
raising of the curtain.</p>

<p class='c000' >Behind him, the leader of the orchestra wiped
his eyeglasses, looked at his watch, passed a
word by the second violin to the oboe concerning
a late correction, and, tapping his baton, began
the overture.</p>

<p class='c000' >Bang! Bang! Bang! pounded thrice the
stage manager with measured precision, and,
with a final glance at the people on the stage,
gave the signal to the head electrician who
turned a switch. Up went the curtain.</p>

<p class='c000' >The night’s work had begun.</p>

<p class='c000' >For the three hours that ensued during the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i>, ballets succeeded ballets. There were
burlesques upon current topics and singing
choruses. All through this the stage management
was perfect.</p>

<p>CHORUS GOSSIP</p>

</div>

<p class='c000' >When you consider the lack of room it was all
the more remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000' >“You see,” said the stage manager, during
one of his free minutes, “we are terribly cramped
for room here upon this old stage. Our biggest
flats we set with this panorama arrangement”—and
he pointed to two giant rollers, one on
either side of the stage. Then, leading the way
beneath the stage, he showed me the two great
wheels and the dynamo that moved them.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Look out!” said he, as we returned to the
stage, “that is the finale of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">commère’s</span></i> song
and we are going to make a quick change.
Stand there!” he said, and instinctively I jumped
for the spot he indicated. At the same instant
the two electricians pulled a combination of
switches and everything went black.</p>

<p class='c000' >Scene-shifters hurried through the gloom with
awkward sections of scenery, all of which had to
be taken back through a doorway and replaced
in order where they had come from. Others
hurried on the stage with properties and sections
for the new set.</p>

<p class='c000' >The stage was, fortunately, warm, otherwise
many of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petites Parisiennes</span></i> who were descending
the winding stairs would have suffered from
even the slightest current of air, for most of their
clothes had been left in the dressing-rooms
above.</p>

<p class='c000' >I saw among this “big family,” that are together
during a long season, the best of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">camaraderie</span></i>
and unusual deference and courtesy by every
man toward the women.</p>

<p class='c000' >During the second act I found that exceedingly
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chic</span></i> and attractive <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comédienne</span></i>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle Léa
Dorville</span>, in her loge.</p>

<p class='c000' >Every available corner of her small room did
good service. Rows of pink and Nile green silk
petticoats, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">frous-frous</span></i> and things hung from hooks
under cretonned shelves.</p>

<p class='c000' >Other hooks held <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mademoiselle</span>’s stage hats,
some of them as big as circus hoops. Her
duchesse table was a veritable museum of little
necessaries: hare’s-feet and powder puffs, mirrors,
sticks of grease paint, a pot of cold cream
with a silver top, a box of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poudre de riz</span></i>, rouge for
her lips, for her nails, for the tips of her ears.
It was all artificial, but it was nevertheless one
real side of life. Serious gaiety if you will, since
to survive the daily routine of the stage is hard
work.</p>

<p class='c000' >Being Sunday, that day they had already gone
through a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matinée</span>. There is but little time to
rest between the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matinée</span> and the evening performance,
and in Paris the theaters are not out
until midnight.</p>

<p class='c000' >All this activity behind the scenes of the Folies
Bergère seemed in strong contrast to the idle
leisure of the audience in front, who during the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entr’actes</span></i> strolled among the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-mondaines</span></i> in the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">promenoir</span></i> or lounged comfortably in arm-chairs
pulled up to the café tables of the alcoves, and
with a cooling drink listened to the band of
Neapolitans.</p>

<p class='c000' >The curtain fell upon an apotheosis representing
the palace of gems; upon <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Belle Otéro</span>
clothed in solitaires; upon the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">commère</span></i> and the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">compère</span></i> bowing to an appreciative audience; and
finally upon a stageful of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">figurantes</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coryphées</span></i>
who, as the final curtain fell, made a rush
for their dressing-rooms. Half an hour later
they all said <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonsoir</span></i> to the doorkeeper and scattered
among the highways and byways of the
city. Some who passed out wore sables; others,
who half an hour before stood flashing in gems,
went away in modest clothes of their own
making. Some departed to meet their sweethearts,
others to their families or their children;
some to supper at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Café de Paris</span>, to Pousset’s
and to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Café Riche</span>, others to little snuggeries
where the cheapest dish was the most popular,
and where the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vieux monsieur</span></i> with the purse of
gold never came.</p>

<p class='c000' >I found the stage of another big music-hall,
the Olympia, differing widely from the cramped
and picturesque old stage of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Folies Bergère</span>.
Here there was plenty of room and sufficient
stage height for scenic spectacles. Back of all
this, wide corridors led to the offices of administration
and comfortable dressing-rooms. Here
again I found a safe corner behind the proscenium,
out of the way of changing scenery and the
toes of the agile <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mademoiselles</span> of the ballet.</p>

<p class='c000' >One seldom sees a more beautiful woman than
the present <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">commère</span></i> of the Olympia <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i>, Germaine
Gallois. She is tall, lithe and queenly,
with clear-cut features and a wealth of golden
hair. With Lucien Noël and the statuesque
Graziella the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i> is not lacking in talent. From
the shadows of the wings framed by the side of
the proscenium in deep shadow against the
flood of orange calcium light, the glitter of the
scene upon the stage seemed even more brilliant
than when viewed from the house.</p>

<p class='c000' >Three fourths of the performers in Parisian
vaudeville are Americans, English or Austrians.
These naturally can not be employed in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revue</span></i>
following the vaudeville, for they do not speak
French.</p>

<p class='c000' >It is the custom to print in English the billposters
announcing these artists. It seems
more of a novelty to Parisians if the lady on the
high wire appears on the bills as “Miss Dorita
Gayford, Queen of the High Wire.” In London
you will see this lady who is on such good terms
with the attraction of gravitation, billed as
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle Céleste Pirrizetti, Reine du
Fil de Fer</span>.” It is more interesting, just as a
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chateaubriand aux pommes soufflées</span>” is more
attractive upon a bill of fare than plain “steak
and fried potatoes.”</p>

<p class='c000' >To us Americans who are accustomed to our
modern theaters fitted with every appliance for
safety and comfort, the old-fashioned playhouses
of Paris, seasoned by time and tradition, seem
quite primitive in construction. Many of them
have remained for nearly a century materially
unchanged. The narrow semi-circular corridors
leading to the orchestra through little velveted
doors have low ceilings.</p>

<p class='c000' >That the most sought after seats are those in
the first balcony is due to the fact that in
many of the theaters the first rows in the orchestra
are sunk so low below an unusually high
stage that it is impossible to see more than the
upper half of the performers. Then, too, the hood
of the prompter’s box is invariably placed in the
middle of the stage. Add to this a lady in front
with a theater hat of such dimensions that it
would serve much better as a sunshade, and the
spectator near the front row has left to his vision
a little triangular space bounded on the base by
the footlights, on one side by the prompt-box,
and on the other by a bobbing ostrich plume.
Across this aperture, provided the ostrich
feather keeps still, you may, by good luck, from
time to time see the villain pursue the heroine.</p>

<p class='c000' >The French playhouse is a slave to traditional
custom. The stone stairways worn by the feet of
generations of audiences have sunk badly out of
plumb. There are comfortable old foyers and
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fumoirs</span></i> to which the audience pour during the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entr’actes</span></i>, but the approach to these is painfully
slow through narrow corridors and up
winding flights of stairs.</p>

<p class='c000' >The boxes lined along beneath the first balcony
and circling the orchestra are narrow, and
insufferably warm in summer. Besides the
open loges there are boxes screened by grilles
of gilt lattice, where <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span> and another
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span>’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span> may secrete themselves,
discreet even in their indiscretions—but why
gossip of the happiness of others?—there is
enough misery in the world as it is.</p>

<p class='c000' >Those gray-haired old ladies, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ouvreuses</span></i>,
are traditional, too; they hang the coats and
wraps along the wall of the narrow corridor into
which the audience goes out, with the result
that at the end of the performance the corridor
is jammed with people in search of their belongings.</p>

<p class='c000' >There is no orchestra except in those theaters
in which the performance as in opéra bouffes
and musical comedies requires one. During the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entr’actes</span></i> Frenchmen stand in their orchestra
places and carefully look over the audience who
have remained in their seats, with their opera-glasses,
until the stage manager pounds his
staff solemnly for the rising of the curtain. It is
the custom, too, to use hideous drop curtains
between the acts covered with advertisements
of perfumery, automobiles, and of winter and
summer resorts.</p>

<p class='c000' >But if there are many little discomforts within
Parisians theaters, the interiors themselves are
rich in works of art. The foyers contain superb
busts and rare pictures. There are ceilings,
mellowed in color by time, which were painted
by the best masters. If many of these auditoriums
are uncomfortable, they possess a
charm and a dignity which age alone can give.</p>

<p class='c000' >Take for example the old <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Palais Royal</span>. This
famous old playhouse has a cozy old-fashioned
auditorium and a foyer with a quaint gallery,
and a rich frieze which illustrates the history of
the theater since the day when <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle de
Montansier</span> in 1789 bought the Beaujolais, a
little playhouse constructed as a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">théâtre des marionnettes</span></i>.
From that year the old theater existed
under many names, until in 1848 it adopted the
title of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre du Palais Royal</span>,” a
name which it still retains. One feels within it
that but for the modern costumes of the audience
he might be living in the time of the First
Empire. The windows of the foyer look out
upon the dimly lighted courtyard of the palace
of Richelieu.</p>

<p class='c000' >Like the ruddy back of some old violin, the interior
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre du Palais Royal</span> has become
rich and polished by the hands of time. It has
become a Parisian institution, beloved by men
and women of culture because of its associations.</p>

<p class='c000' >If you ask a Parisian at which theaters you
can see the best plays, he will invariably answer:
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre Antoine</span> and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre Français</span>.
He adds the latter as a matter of habit,
for the French have been brought up for generations
to regard the immortal house of the great
Molière as the best stage.</p>

<p class='c000' >It is there he received his first impression of
the theater when in his childhood as a reward of
merit he was taken to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Français</span> to see classical
plays. He was told it was the best theater,
and this impression has remained with him since
infancy. For French children are taken as a
matter of education to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Français</span> and the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Odéon</span>.</p>

<p class='c000' >True, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comédie Française</span> possesses finished
actors; true, also, they are trying to keep
up traditions there more than anywhere else;
true, as well, the scenery and costumes are of
the best. But it is also true that many of the
good actors of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Français</span> have in late years deserted
the house of Molière for freer fields, that
the managers have refused scores of good plays
in late years which have been subsequent successes
at other theaters, and that most of the
present actors of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Français</span>, wishing to create
a “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">genre</span></i>,” or shall we call it a mannerism, of
their own, do so at the expense of the true character
of the rôle which they play. Many of them
who have become celebrated refuse to play
small parts and, what is even more to be regretted,
disdain to learn the classical repertoire
which is the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d’être</span></i> of the house of Molière.</p>

<p>A DRESS REHEARSAL AT THE THÉÂTRE FRANÇAIS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >But if the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Français</span> does not choose to present
new plays and encourage modern authorship for
which purposes the government gives it yearly
a large subvention, other theaters do, and the
public have filled them.</p>

<p class='c000' >But even these latter theaters are hampered
by the system of stars and the desire to attract
the public by the well-known name of a successful
author on the bill.</p>

<p class='c000' >Sometimes the play of the successful author,
like the little girl with the curl in the middle of
her forehead, is very, very good, and sometimes
very, very bad, but it is always very, very expensive.
On account of these stars and successful
authors, the seats have to be sold at a high
price. Once the expense of production of the
play is covered, the play is forced to a long run,
thus limiting the chance of a new one being
given.</p>

<p class='c000' >For these reasons and many others M. Antoine,
a young man who was an employee of the
city gas company, conceived in 1887 an idea
of an entirely different theater where all old
traditions would be put aside, where a play
would not be given more than two weeks, thus
opening the door to a great many authors, and
where a company of thirty-six actors would play
impartially all rôles and each one would receive
for his services the same pay.</p>

<p class='c000' >The plays given should be upon every-day life,
therefore no expensive costumes or elaborate
scenery would be needed.</p>

<p class='c000' >The actors were not to come from a dramatic
school, but teach themselves by experience.</p>

<p class='c000' >Realism was to pervade everything: acting,
costumes, scenery and properties.</p>

<p class='c000' >In March, 1887, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. Antoine</span> organized the first
representation of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jacques Damour</span>,” which was
such a success that it was taken immediately by
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Odéon</span>. The performance was given in a
cheap little auditorium in Montmartre, hired at
as low a figure as possible for the occasion.
None of the actors were professionals. In this
first representation of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Puissance des Ténèbres</span>,”
the cast was: Men—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Antoine</span>,
still employee of the gas company, an
employee of the Minister of Finances, a secretary
at Police headquarters, an architect, a chemist,
a drummer and a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marchand de vin</span></i>. Women—a
dressmaker, a bookbinder, an employee at
the Post-office, etc., etc. All this cast rehearsed
in the evening after long hours in office
and store.</p>

<p class='c000' >In spite of keeping expenses as low as possible,
Antoine was in debt after the first representation
and was obliged to wait two months
before he could give another performance.</p>

<p class='c000' >Finally the company succeeded in giving
seven or eight representations in a little <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle</span></i> of
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rue Blanche</span>, and from there went to the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre Montparnasse</span>, and thence to the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Menus Plaisirs</span>, where the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre Libre</span> exists
at the present day under the name of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre Antoine</span>.</p>

<p class='c000' >With this little company it was not always
easy sailing. Had it not been at the time for
the generous help of the press and the kindness
of the director of the vaudeville who sub-rented
his hall to the ambitious troupe for next to
nothing, it would have met with financial ruin.
But the plays they gave attracted attention.
Nowhere had such daring realism and freedom
from old traditions been attempted.</p>

<p class='c000' >From 1887 to 1890 the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre Libre</span> produced
one hundred and twenty-five new “acts,” and
presented the plays of thirty dramatic authors
whose work had never been heard before. Besides
these, they produced the plays of fourteen
authors whose work had been represented in
Paris only once.</p>

<p class='c000' >They had upon their programs among others
the plays of Zola, Tolstoy, Turgéneff, and Ibsen,
and introduced many plays which subsequently
were reproduced upon the best stages of Paris.
The good that Antoine has accomplished by his
indomitable energy and the efforts of those who
have been with him through these experiments
is sufficiently proven by the fact that while the
company produced one hundred and twenty-five
plays, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Français</span> during that same period of
time produced only twenty-five new plays and received
seven hundred and twenty thousand francs
from the government as subvention, a sum given
towards the expense of mounting new plays.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Odéon</span> during this time produced sixty-seven
“acts” and received three hundred thousand
francs from the government!</p>

<p class='c000' ><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Antoine</span> does not believe in considering
that a room has only three sides. That is
why he maintains it is legitimate to turn one’s
back on an audience if by reason of stage position
the situation calls for it. Neither does he
believe the room in which the drama occurs can
be surrounded by imaginary apartments of dingy
canvas, so the doors upon his stage have real
locks and open upon other rooms as realistically
furnished as the one within whose walls the
action takes place.</p>

<p class='c000' >In the matter of costumes he is equally realistic,
and every detail of the style is genuine.</p>

<p class='c000' >If it is a question of a library, there are real
books upon real shelves. These important
attentions to detail are carried out through
all his plays. He does not believe that, because
an object is at the back of the stage, it should
be made of papier maché or, what is worse,
painted on the back flat.</p>

<p class='c000' >When you have seen three of his late productions,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Fille Eliza</span>,” the story of a girl condemned
to death; “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Bonne Espérance</span>,” a
tragedy of a Holland fishing town; and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Indiscret</span>,”
a modern society play; you will realize
the genius and capability of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Antoine</span>
and his rare company who work conscientiously
together for the ensemble of a finished production
rather than for individual applause.</p>

<p class='c000' >Among the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haut monde</span></i> of Paris the finesse of
the most complex social intrigue is understood
to perfection. The Parisian society play deals
with a series of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">risqué</span></i> situations.</p>

<p>A STAR’S DRESSING-ROOM</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >The noisy, cruel, villain of the society play as
we know him is not seen here. The three principal
characters are the “Charming and Beautiful
Wife,” the “Distinguished Husband,”
whom she does not love, and the “Jolly Young
Man,” whom she does. Her attractive salon
seems to be especially adapted to the furtherance
of the amours of certain of her women
friends whose husbands, it is to be presumed,
are having tea and conversation elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000' >Matrimony is taken for granted as a calamity,
an unfortunate episode to be remedied as soon
as possible.</p>

<p class='c000' >In the second act the Charming Wife heavily
veiled sweeps into the Jolly Young Man’s modest
apartment.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Enfin!</span></i>” he cries, and the lovers embrace as
if in a dream.</p>

<p class='c000' >This is quite an exciting part, for it is not long
now before you will hear the heavy foot of the
deceived husband upon the stairs.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah! voilà!</span></i> here he comes!” The Charming
Wife emits a little stifled scream as she
recognizes his step, and the Jolly Young Man,
failing to hide her in his wardrobe, puts on as
bold a front as possible and awaits the opening
of his door.</p>

<p class='c000' >Enter the Husband!</p>

<p class='c000' >Not in a frenzy, with cocked revolver as we are
used to seeing him, not a bit of it. He comes in
pleasantly and bows formally to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span> and to
the Jolly Young Man. Through all he preserves
the dignity of a visiting general with a flag of
truce. He even begs the pardon of the Jolly
Young Man for his interruption.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Will you have the goodness, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>, to
leave <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span> and myself alone for a moment;
I have something which I wish to say in
private?”</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parfaitement, monsieur</span></i>,” answers as ceremoniously
the Jolly Young Man, and goes out.</p>

<p class='c000' >When the Jolly Young Man has gone, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span>
attempts the usual distracted flood of explanations,
then, realizing the artificiality of them all,
shrugs her shoulders.</p>

<p class='c000' >It is at this juncture that the Husband, as if
speaking to some indiscreet comrade, addresses
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span> as “my friend.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon amie</span></i>,” he begins, “you must know that
I, too, love another.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“You have a mistress, of course,” replies
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span>, accepting this foregone conclusion as a
preliminary to what may follow.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Naturally, my friend, but it is not of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle
de Tréville</span> that I speak, it is of one of
your best friends, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une femme sérieuse, exquise, ravissante</span></i>!”
and he clasps his hand and looks toward
heaven.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Louise?” asks <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span>.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parfaitement, mon amie.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tiens!</span></i> That is funny,” replies <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span>,
with a little amused smile; “but what of her
husband?”</p>

<p class='c000' >“It will be difficult, but I think it can be arranged,”
replies <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span> dramatically.</p>

<p class='c000' >Upon the reentrance of the Jolly Young Man,
all three begin a breezy conversation touching
as lightly as possible upon the painful episode of
the interrupted rendezvous.</p>

<p class='c000' >“I leave for Nice to-morrow,” says the Husband,
picking up his silk hat and his yellow kid
gloves. “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonsoir, mes amis</span></i>,” and he bows himself
out through the modest portal of the Jolly
Young Man’s apartment as the curtain falls.</p>

<p>MARDI GRAS ON THE BOULEVARD DES ITALIENS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012' >All Paris poured into the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grands Boulevards</span>
on <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mardi Gras</span>. From the Madeleine to the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place de la Bastille</span>, this broad thoroughfare
was a compact surging sea of human beings.
Those who had space enough danced, some as
clowns, some as harlequins. There were women
in doublets and hose, in boys’ clothes, in every
conceivable get-up that could be dragged from
the boxes of cheap costumers. This human sea
laughed at each other in the best of good nature
and threw paper confetti tit for tat all day and
half the night. Paris seemed to have been
visited by a vari-colored blizzard that roared
whirling by, a February wind, over the heads of
the sea of merry-makers. It piled itself in great
kaleidoscopic drifts in the gutters and got down
thousands of people’s necks. The air was filled
with dust, and from the balconies shot long
streamers of paper ribbons, some caught in the
trees below, others fell entangling themselves
round the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chapeaux</span></i> of the passing crowd.</p>

<p class='c000' >At certain points the busses crossed amid
cheers, but otherwise no vehicles were allowed
on the boulevards. A rabbit would have had
hard work getting through in a hurry from the
Madeleine to the Bastille, so compact was the
crowd. In all this fun and gaiety I did not see a
fight or a drunken man, and I observed the show
as long as it lasted. It began on Sunday, when
a procession of students started from the Sorbonne
and marched across the Seine, a somewhat
disappointing cavalcade in length but which,
nevertheless, half of Paris turned out to see and
applaud.</p>

<p class='c000' >The carnival reached its height on Tuesday
and in the early hours of Wednesday morning.</p>

<p class='c000' >There were <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bal masqués</span></i> galore, for nearly
every one had dressed for them in the morning.</p>

<p class='c000' >At the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bullier</span>, the Gay Tivoli, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moulin
de la Galette</span>, carnival reigned supreme.</p>

<p class='c000' >At the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bal Bullier</span> one had to take more than
a passing glance to tell the boys from the girls,
for the Mimis and Fantines had often tucked up
their hair and donned sailors’ clothes or a Tuxedo.
Others went in scantier attire and were
more distinguishable. There were feminine Méphistos,
Spanish dancers, little brunettes as bullfighters,
and blondes as Oriental favorites of the
harem. When the ball was over, this motley
crowd romped down to supper along the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boul
Mich</span>” in their fantastic clothes, and had <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marennes
vertes</span></i> and cold champagne and beer and
sandwiches in the hostelries of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quartier
Latin</span>.</p>

<p class='c000' >But all this was only a slice in the carnival pie,
for Montmartre was a bedlam, and the boulevards
were still packed and as jolly as they had
been when I crossed that thoroughfare on the
top of a bus and saw a surging sea of color.
Such screaming and cheering I have never seen
elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000' >Clowns were everywhere, acrobats did flip-flaps
from the sand bins along the route of the
Metropolitan, street bands blared away from the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">terrasses</span></i> of the cafés, sidewalk venders did a
thriving trade in confetti, sold in paper bags,
which were warranted to hold a true kilo. Later
some of these confetti hawkers began replenishing
their stock from the sidewalk where it could
literally be gathered by the shovelful.</p>

<p class='c000' >All this happened a day ago; before noon
Wednesday, Paris had been swept as clean as a
whistle.</p>

<p class='c012' >Alas! the famous <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bal Masqué de l’Opéra</span> is no
more in its splendor.</p>

<p class='c000' >The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bal masqué</span></i> to which once upon a time all
of gay Paris went in domino and mask is now
filled by the daughters of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concierges</span></i>, by barbers
and jockeys and a general riff-raff, most of whom
have entered by billets of favor. Besides these
there are a few dominoed ladies in the boxes
who may once have graced the ball in the old
days, and now and then a pretty woman in black
silk tights passes through the foyer, and is ogled
by the remnant of the aged <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roués</span></i> who stroll
about comparing the present with the glitter
and beauty of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Opéra</span> ball when it was one of
the sights of the world, frequented by the most
celebrated and beautiful of women. All this has
gone; the crowd is motley, noisy and common.
The leading feature at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Opéra</span> ball this year
was the cake-walk, over which all Paris has
suddenly gone mad.</p>

<p class='c000' >It is an amusing sight to see the Parisian
dance it; he forms his ideas of the cake-walk
mostly from some of the exaggerated illustrations
published in the London journals, and
combines these with a touch of plantation grace
taken from the steel engravings out of a French
history of early Alabama.</p>

<p class='c000' >I know a celebrated French ballet master who
has had his hands full training Parisians in the
art of cake-walking. As a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître de ballet</span></i> there is
none better to be found, but his ideas upon the
innate grace of “Syncopated Sandy” are somewhat
vague.</p>

<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Thérèse Baudière</span>’s
brown eyes and the
pink-and-white freshness of her
skin are in charming contrast to
her gray hair, which she wears
in the coiffure of a certain marquise
of a century ago. Sometimes
on <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span> days, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span> encircles
her white throat with a
black velvet ribbon. Upon these
occasions, she mostly resembles the Watteau-like
marquise whose portrait hangs in the inn
adjoining <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Baudière</span>’s garden. A seasoned
old hostelry is the inn, famous for its vintages
and its sauces, both of which go far toward
cheering the stranger who comes to Poissy.</p>

<p class='c000' >This quaint town upon the bank of the Seine
would be a drowsy little hamlet indeed were it
not so close to Paris that its cobbled streets are
filled on Sundays and holidays with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tuff-tuffs</span></i> and
formidable red racers, which rattle and roar in
their endeavor to stand still long enough to deposit
their dust-begrimed occupants at the door
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span> Dalaison’s inn, the Esturgeon. For
it is quite the thing for Parisians to take their
Sunday <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</span></i> or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dîner</span></i> at this hostelry.</p>

<p class='c000' >When I first saw her, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Baudière</span> was
stepping out of the narrow doorway of her bait
shop and calling lustily to her <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</span> André,
who had reached the shore of a feathery green
island just opposite, and who upon hearing <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span>’s
voice turned his boat about and bent his
broad back to his oars in haste to return.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dépêchez-vous!</span></i>” cried <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span>, as he drew
nearer. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span> wishes the big boat.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bien, madame, tout de suite</span></i>,” answered André,
plunging the
clumsy blades
into the glassy
river which
swings along
past the island
and glides
peacefully on its
way down to
Normandy and
the sea.</p>

a green cotton umbrella watches intently
a tiny red quill floating midway up his line, altho
it has given no signal of alarm for hours.</p>

<p class='c000' >A gentle breeze shirrs the surface of the
water. The old gentleman pours a little <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vin ordinaire</span></i>
into a glass, rebaits his hook, and lights a
fresh cigar. Masses of white clouds overhead
float in the clear blue sky.</p>

<p class='c000' >Just around the point of the island another
boat is moored to two long poles. In it a young
man sits fishing; his sweetheart, who a night
ago had been dining at Maxime’s exquisitely
gowned, is now by his side in a calico wrapper
and a straw garden-hat, the brim of which is
pulled down until all that remains visible of her
face is the tip of her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">retroussé</span></i> nose, her rosebud
mouth and her adorable dimpled chin.</p>

<p class='c000' >Shouts and shrieks of laughter come from
other boats tied along this quiet stretch of the
river.</p>

<p class='c000' >Tiny villas, their gardens gay in geraniums,
skirt the edge of the stream, where on little
wharves sheltered by awnings other Parisians
spend the day a fishing. On one of these an old
lady in a black silk dress reclines in an armchair,
her fishing-rod thrust in a convenient rest,
while she occupies herself with her fancy work,
talking at intervals to her husband, a dapper
little man in a white waistcoat. The family
butler has just brought him a fresh pailful of
bait, the first supply having been exhausted in
the capture of two diminutive <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">goujons</span></i>, a delicate
little fish playing an important part in every
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">friture</span></i> along the Seine. It is served like whitebait,
crisp and garnished with watercress and
lemon. Opposite my own boat there is another
villa half hidden in the tangle of a pretty garden
full of roses.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>THE QUIET STRETCH</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c000' >Here a flat barge is moored to the bank, and
in it three people are fishing. In the bow sits a
genial clean-shaven old gentleman, a celebrated
actor, whose red cravat is reflected in the
water by a wiggling scarlet spiral. In the
middle of the barge is seated <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle
Yvette</span>, of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bouffes Parisiennes</span>. Her cork has
just disappeared with the rush of a foolish <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">goujon</span></i>,
and is straightway pulled up, amid screams from
the excited <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demoiselle</span>, with a jerk sufficient to
land a whale. At her side a man of thirty-five,
sunburned, well-built and immaculate in white
flannels, is extricating the unfortunate <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">goujon</span></i>
from the tangled hook and line.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oh! c’est beau! n’est-ce pas, Jacques?</span></i>” cries
Yvette, clapping her hands.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, oui, ma petite</span></i>,” returns Jacques, happy
over her delight.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Et toi, chéri</span></i>,” laughs Yvette, consolingly,
“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tu n’as encore rien attrappé, ça ne fait rien, je te donnerai
le mien</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c000' >The old gentleman with the scarlet tie rises
and bows majestically to Yvette in recognition
of her skill.</p>

<p class='c000' >A short pantomime follows, in which these two
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bons garçons</span></i> present her with a wreath of honor
made of leaves gathered from the bank.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah! mes enfants</span></i>,” cries Yvette, “you are always
so good to me!” and she kisses the old gentleman
in quite a fatherly way on both cheeks and
gives her beloved Jacques a little hug of delight.
Then all three return seriously to their fishing.</p>

<p>ENTHUSIASTS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >Now the shutters of an upper window of the
villa open and the blond head of Suzanne is
thrust out in greeting.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonjour, mes enfants!</span></i>” she calls cheerily to
the three.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah! ah! Oh! oh! tiens!</span></i> it is really you at
last!” cry the industrious ones.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Oh! you lazy girl,” shouts Jacques.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonjour</span></i>,” adds the old gentleman in mock
sarcasm. “It is a pity you are so confoundedly
lazy that you can not give us the honor of your
gracious company! A fine fisherwoman you,
who swore last night by Psyche you would be
up before the sun had crept over yonder hillock
and kissed the river with its rays!”</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tout à l’heure, mon vieux</span></i>,” returns Suzanne,
with a rippling laugh. “The day is yet young;
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au revoir, mes enfants</span></i>.” And Suzanne, extricating
one dimpled elbow from her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peignoir</span></i>, blows the
three enthusiasts a kiss and closes the shutters.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Ingrate!” cry all three.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Eh! do you hear?” roars Jacques, “we
have Chambertin for lunch—you shall not have
a drop.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dormeuse!</span></i>” shouts Yvette. “You shall not
see Gaston when he comes, or even the tail of
my beautiful <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">goujon</span></i>!”</p>

<p class='c000' >“Enough,” thunders the old gentleman, melodramatically,
“you shall not leave your boudoir,
not even tho the populace cry ‘The Queen! the
Queen! let us see the Queen!’ Consider it
henceforth as your dungeon. I have given
orders to the guards without.” The shutters
open half way.</p>

<p>AN HABITUÉ</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >“Has anyone caught anything!” ventures
shyly the owner of the shower of golden hair.</p>

<p class='c000' >“One!” savagely reply the others.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Who caught it?” comes excitedly from the
window.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Yvette!”</p>

<p class='c000' >“Bravo!” applauds Suzanne. “I am coming
down!” And she does, making her way through
the roses. Her exquisite hair is twisted in a
hurried coil. The voluminous sleeves of her
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peignoir</span></i> reveal her pretty bare arms as she runs.
The next instant Suzanne is in the barge fishing
with the rest.</p>

<p class='c000' >Bees drone lazily over the flowers in the tiny
garden; the river flashes in the warm sun; a
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carillon</span></i> of bells from a breezy belfry on the hillside
strikes noon, and the four enthusiasts pull
up their lines and go to <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000' >A table in the garden is laid for eight. Marie,
Suzanne’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne</span>, is drying the salad vigorously
in its wire cage. In a cool corner the cobwebbed
bottles of Chambertin sleep in their baskets.</p>

<p>THE OLD BRIDGE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >The train has brought Gaston and his friend,
a young officer. An automobile growls and sputters
up the villa with the leading villain of a
Parisian theater, a man full of kindly good humor,
accompanied by a graceful woman with jet-black
hair, a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">danseuse</span></i>. It is Tuesday, there is
no <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matinée</span> and every one is happy.</p>

<p class='c000' >And how gay they are! how full of spirit and
rollicking camaraderie! How many toasts are
drank, how many clever songs are sung during
the whole of this bohemian breakfast! The
officer and Jacques move the short upright piano
close to the table. Suzanne, now the pink of
neatness, with a little laugh mounts a chair,
raises her glass through which the light glints
as golden as her hair, and sings the aria from
Charpentier’s “Louise.” The small company
are silent in ecstasy under the spell of her mellow
voice. The lines of smoke rising from the
cigarettes seem like fires of incense burning in
adoration of this fascinating little goddess whose
golden heart has made her a rare good comrade.</p>

<p class='c000' >And so with song and story the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</span></i> ends.
There is no more fishing. Yvette and Jacques
go for a walk; the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">danseuse</span></i> and the villain start
in their <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tuff-tuff</span></i> back to Paris; the old gentleman
with the scarlet tie takes a nap; Suzanne
and Gaston row down the river, and the officer
returns to his barracks. Only when the moon
floods the garden with its light do the lovers return.
In the garden the roses pale in the glow
of candles from the windows of the villa, nodding
their heads sleepily in the night breeze. A bat
zigzags over the tops of the hollyhocks; two
little birds high up in the tree peep their last
good-night. Dinner is at eight.</p>

<p>A PICNIC PARTY</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >Past this rural paradise the silent river glides
and tells no tales.</p>

<p class='c000' >I pulled up my anchor and rowed back to the
inn. The villa with its happy day had fascinated
me.</p>

<p class='c000' >There must be hundreds of others like it along
the Seine, I argued. That night I made up my
mind to take a trip in a rowboat down to Rouen.</p>

<p class='c000' >I was warned, by my good landlord of the inn,
that such a voyage would be fraught with untold
hardships and danger.</p>

<p class='c000' >“And in what way?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Ah! <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>, there are the locks, and,
when the wind blows, the river gets very rough.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span> should take a brave and strong <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marin</span></i>
with him to make such a journey.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“Have you ever been down the Seine?”</p>

<p class='c000' >“Only once, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>, on a canal-boat with
my brother-in-law to Mantes, where he became
cook to a famous hostelry. It was he who came
yesterday and made the sauce to the sole you
have just eaten.”</p>

<p class='c000' >I bowed my compliments. If his seamanship
was as good as his cooking, the brother-in-law
could have commanded a man-of-war.</p>

<p class='c000' >In the matter of finding a suitable boat I experienced
some difficulty. There were many to
be had, painted sky-blue or apple-green, and
bearing romantic names like Juliette or Gabrielle,
but their sea-going qualities were none
of the best, and moreover most of them leaked
badly. They might have done for half-an-hour’s
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belle promenade</span></i> with Marcelle or Céleste, but I
doubted their worthiness for the perilous adventure
from which
my friend the innkeeper
had tried
to dissuade me.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>A SEINE TYPE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >I was told that
at Bougival I
would surely find
what I desired.
My time was getting
short and I
took the train
there to inquire.
Visions of light,
perfectly appointed
canoes filled
my mind as I got off at the station. I could almost
see them lying by dozens snubbed to dapper
wharves ready to be rented. The river flashed in
the warm sun and swung under cool archways.
The people whom I passed on my way through
the village looked nautical enough. I stopped the
likeliest looking one as I crossed the bridge, a
bronzed, thick-set man wearing a sailor’s cap.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Can I rent a rowboat here, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='c000' >He looked at me in a dazed sort of way, then,
shaking the ashes from his stubby pipe, became
lost in thought. Had you asked him for
a balloon he could not have been more puzzled.</p>

<p class='c000' >“A rowboat,” I reiterated.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah! monsieur, un bateau à rames, ah!</span></i> that is
difficult. The miller used to have one a year
ago, but he sold it.”</p>

<p class='c000' >I walked along down the river in the direction
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont de Chatou</span>, through waving fields of
wheat gay with scarlet poppies. Suddenly in
the distance I saw the lateen sail of a canoe
showing above the bank. Another half mile and
I had reached the bridge. Here several rowboats
were drawn up to a float in front of the
workshop of a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">constructeur</span></i>. The builder himself
came out to greet me. He was a pleasant little
man and seemed much interested when I told
him what I wanted. He motioned me to follow
him and, unlocking the door of a barnlike structure,
ushered me in. Suspended from the ceiling
hung a score of racing boats and shells, the
property of a Parisian boat club. Tucked away
in a corner of the floor I saw my boat! A St.
Lawrence canoe, clinker-built and perfect in all
its appointments.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Where the devil did you get this?” I cried.</p>

<p class='c000' >He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c000' >“It belongs to the gentleman whose <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">château</span>
you passed on the river. He brought it from
America himself.”</p>

<p class='c000' >My spirits fell.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Will he rent it?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Ah! <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>, I do not know, but you could
ask him. He is the head of a famous firm in
Paris,” and he gave me his address.</p>

<p class='c000' >The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concierge</span></i> who ushered me the following
day into the private office of the head of the firm
in question, informed me that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span> would
see me in half an hour. Could I wait? At the
end of this time <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>, an imposing looking
man with a red ribbon in his buttonhole, entered
the room with all the ceremonious courtesy
found among Parisian men of affairs.</p>

<p class='c000' >We both bowed low and he motioned me to a
Louis XVI. chair.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Now, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>, I am at your disposal.”</p>

<p class='c000' >I explained to him that I had not come to
transact affairs affecting the credit of Russia or
to merge anything of any kind.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Then it is not in business that I have the
honor of your visit, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>?”</p>

<p class='c000' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span>,” I said, “I simply want to rent
your boat.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tiens</span></i>, have I a boat?”</p>

<p class='c000' >“Yes,” I reminded him, “at the builder’s, below
your country place at Chatou.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“Ah! yes,” and he laughed heartily. “Yes!
yes! so I have, I had almost forgotten it; it has
been so long since I have been there. It was
the green one you liked?”</p>

<p class='c000' >“No! no, the American canoe,” I explained.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah! parfaitement!</span></i> But, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>, that is not
mine; it belongs to my brother. He left town
yesterday, but you could write him here explaining
what you wish and I will leave it here on
his desk.”</p>

<p class='c000' >He touched an electric button over an escritoire,
and left me with a low bow. I began to
write. I had just slipped the note in its envelope
when his brother entered unexpectedly—a
placid gentleman with a well-trimmed beard.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span>,” I began in my rapid French, “it
is for the difficulty of having to find a boat of
oars that I have become desolate that has inspired
me to come to you to ask you to rent me
yours which I find of the type ravishing to my
eyes as well as practical to the voyage.”</p>

<p class='c000' >He smiled pleasantly as I talked on, putting
his hand to his ear. At last he spoke in a high-keyed,
monotonous voice.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span>, the lady whom you speak of I am
not acquainted with.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“It is not a lady!” I replied in my best megaphone
French. “It is a boat, your canoe, at
Chatou; want to rent it?”</p>

<p class='c000' >His face brightened at last, I thought.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Ah! the little canoe Américain. But it is not
mine, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>, it belongs to my brother Achille.
He is out of town.”</p>

<p class='c000' >I thanked him, left the note and bowed myself
out, saving my more intricate vocabulary for the
open air. Three days later I received the following
answer:</p>

<p class='c016' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span>,</p>

<p class='c016' >“I am truly desolate, I beg of you to believe

request, but it will be impossible for me to rent
my St. Lawrence skiff. I hope sincerely you can
find what you wish. Might I suggest hunting
at Asnières? If I am not intruding, let me advise
you, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>, to take for that delightful
little voyage so Arcadian, a strong rope of thirty
meters and a gaff which will prove useful in
going through the locks.</p>

<p class='c016' >“Permit me to express to you again, sir, my

<p class='ce-caption'>THE BOAT BUILDERS AT ARGENTEUIL</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c000' >Finally, just outside of Paris, at Asnières, in
the workshop of a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">constructeur de bateaux</span></i>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur
Malo Lebreton</span>, I discovered an excellent
boat, brand-new, but rather heavy and flat-bottomed.
Both of these seeming defects, however,
proved advantages before the end of the trip. A
short portable mast carried a leg-of-mutton sail,
which I hoisted one sunny afternoon, and left
Asnières, with a fair wind driving me along under
old bridges and past little islands in the
direction of Argenteuil.</p>

<p class='c000' >Rounding the edge of a wooded island, a
weird object came floating toward me, silhouetted
against the copperish red disk of the setting sun.
It was a strange craft, a short squat boat sunk
deep in the water, carrying a black lugger sail,
and steered by an old man grizzled and bent
with age. A tawny, yellowish mass was loaded
across the middle of the boat. As it drew nearer,
I saw the body of a lioness, her head resting on
her great paws. She was dead. Her long life
of captivity had ended in the menagerie of some
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête foraine</span></i> down the river. Here was a breath of
the twilight air and the cool smell of the fresh
woods and freedom, but for her they were too
late. Father Time was steering her down the
golden river to her grave. As she drifted close
by, the old man neither spoke nor raised his
eyes. Slowly the boat of the dead drifted by,
and the bend of the river hid it from view.</p>

<p class='c000' >The fair wind, which so far had driven me before
it, suddenly changed, and for hours the boat
crept against a head wind that roused itself into
a stiff river gale and slapped the tops of running
waves across the bow. The breeze held its position
so persistently for a succeeding one hundred
and fifty miles, that often it was a daily
fight to keep from shore.</p>

<p class='c000' >So tortuous is the course of the Seine, so
many twists and turns does it take to reach a
few kilometers nearer the sea, that the excellent
chart supplied by the nautical journal, “Le
Yacht,” looks like the track of a snake in a box.</p>

<p class='c000' >I managed to reach Argenteuil that night.</p>

<p class='c000' >Near the picturesque bridge there was the
comfortable inn of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Drapeau</span>—jolly, as I entered,
with a bourgeois wedding supper. The
party had arrived from Paris in high two-wheeled
carts filled with chairs. These lumbering
festival vehicles were stowed under the shed
of the courtyard, while, as a precaution against
the upsetting of a friendly glass of wine, many of
the women present had hung their overskirts in
a barn adjoining. It was late when the guests
departed, and during the remainder of the night
other high two-wheeled carts rumbled by, loaded
with vegetables for the Paris <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">halles</span></i>, and shaking
the very ground as they passed. When I
awoke, two automobiles were cooling under the
shed, and a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">partie carrée</span></i> of smartly dressed Parisians
had ordered breakfast under one of the
pretty kiosks in the garden.</p>

<p class='c000' >It was Sunday, and the waiters were hurrying
about setting extra tables for the expected
guests. Soon smart traps and bourgeois carts
began to arrive, the horses being unharnessed
and led from the shafts in front of the little
tables.</p>

</div></div>

<p class='c000' >The landlord whose dual role of cook and proprietor
kept him as busy as the innkeeper in a
comic opera, bustled among his guests or flew to
his kitchen, to look after his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poulets</span></i> and his
sauces.</p>

<p class='c000' >Rich fields and stretches of woodland rolled
back of the inn to the river, still whipped white
by the gale and dotted with scudding sharpie-like
canoes which had ventured out from a neighboring
boat club.</p>

<p class='c000' >The wind having abated the next day, I
pushed down the river, past barges and iron
foundries and rows of steam tow-boats, of which
there are many plying between Paris and Rouen,
moored to the shore.</p>

<p class='c000' >These tow-boats were iron-clad and painted
red. They were propelled by an endless chain
arrangement jutting from bow to stern, which
rattled as it cut the water. A little below
this point, the character of the river changes.
Quiet backwaters sheltered flocks of ducks and
wild doves. By noon I reached the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ile Jolie</span>,” a
cozy restaurant under shady green trees. It had
a ballroom whose walls had been decorated by a
clever caricature of a wedding procession, the
payment, no doubt, for some bohemian supper
of long ago, when <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span> the proprietress was
young and the good comrade of idle painters.</p>

<p class='c000' >Now its <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clientèle</span> has changed, and the scow
used as a ferry is shouted for from the opposite
bank by Parisians with a fondness for game and
champagne.</p>

<p class='c000' >“It must be lonely here in the winter?” I
venture.</p>

<p class='c000' >“No, indeed, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span>; on the contrary, it is
quite gay.” And she added with a twinkle of
her eye, “They come in the winter to show
their furs.”</p>

<p>HERE, AS EVERYWHERE, THERE ARE PEOPLE FISHING</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000' >Below the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ile Jolie</span>” lie more long, quiet
stretches, smooth backwaters flowing past
feathery green islands full of cooing wild pigeons.
As I round a point, a blue heron squawks
and rises lazily, his long legs dangling. Farther
on, a pair of black ducks scurry out of a
hidden cove.</p>

<p class='c000' >At sundown I glide under the bridge at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont
de Chatou</span>. Here, as everywhere else along the
Seine, there are people fishing. Often, all that
is visible are the spider-webs of lines which lead
from the water into the brush along the banks;
but at the end of each thread buried in the tangle
is some itinerant disciple of the patient
Izaak.</p>

<p class='c000' >A little below all this I carry over a narrow bit
of land to avoid the lock at Bougival. Here the
Seine resembles somewhat the Thames. Fine
estates with formal gardens run to the edge of
the river. Cedar boats gay in colored cushions
and silk parasols are drawn under shady trees,
the nooks of idling house parties. From the
walls of one country place the butler is fishing
in his spare half hour before dinner. The gateway
to this estate is protected by an iron grille
bearing in gilt the crest of the family. A smart
coupé passes, driven by a cockaded coachman.</p>

<p class='c000' >At dusk the forbidding settlement of Pecq
came into view, a sordid collection of gray
houses harboring a wretched combination of a
hotel and tobacco-shop. Above Pecq towers the
forest plateau of St. Germain, with its palace and
balustrades and terraces faced with long avenues
of trees strung out like the wings of an
advancing army, and having an effect which
smacks of the fancies of an extravagant court.</p>

<p class='c000' >Here from the Pavilion Henri IV., where <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chic</span></i>
Paris drives to <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dîner</span></i>, one sees the Seine glistening
far below—a vein of silver running
through a vast undulating ocean of trees.</p>

<p class='c000' >I stop at Maison for <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</span></i> the next day, and
find the proprietress of a river-side café washing
in the public <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lavoir</span></i>. However, she leaves her
suds and scrubbing-board with the best of
humor, and hurries to her kitchen, whence she
emerges a few minutes later with a smoking
omelet, a loaf of bread, and a bottle of wine.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span> will excuse my larder, but we get
ready for Parisians on Sundays.”</p>

<p class='c000' >“Then you have a big crowd on that day?”</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah! monsieur, quel monde!</span></i>” and she went hurrying
back to her kitchen, with her honest face
beaming.</p>

<p class='c000' >The character of the people becomes more
primitive. I row on past La Frette, a red-and-white
town snug against a hillside checkered
with vineyards. At evening I reach Herblay,
and a quaint inn with a tiled kitchen shining in
polished copper. The town is very small, very
crooked and very old. Boat-loads of peasants,
many of them in coats of sheepskins, returned at
evening from their work in the fields.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>A SEINE LOCK</p>
</div></div>

<p class='c000' >It takes a week to reach Havre from Paris by
tow. At the locks tow-lines are slipped and the
procession drifts into the big basins by twos.
Slowly the iron gates close, and the boats sink
gradually to the lower level. As slowly the
gates open at the other end; tow-lines are rehitched,
and the procession goes on its way. By
the side of the big lock there is a narrower one for
the passing through of smaller craft. This, for
a few sous, the lockman will grind open for you.
But more often you arrive in time to go through
at the tail end of a tow and without the slightest
trouble. Evidently the dangers of the locks existed
only in the mind of my landlord at Poissy,
which town now lay just below.</p>

<p class='c000' >It takes barely an hour to reach Poissy from
Paris by train, but by the twisting Seine it is a
long way.</p>

<p class='c000' >It seemed good to get to the Esturgeon again.
The veranda overhanging the river was already
crowded with Parisians, and every automobile
that thundered over the bridge brought more.</p>

<p class='c000' ><i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chateaubriands</span></i> smothered in mushrooms were
being served by hurrying waiters. Roast
ducks and patés came from the busy kitchen.
Champagne frappéed itself in silver coolers, and
older wines slumbered in cradles.</p>

<p class='c000' >Beneath the veranda flowed the Seine, inky
black in the night, and framed by a mass of towering
trees that would have graced a Corot.
Now and then a returning fishing-boat wrinkled
the surface of the dark water, while the boat-lantern
was reflected in ribbons of light in the
depths of the stream.</p>

<p class='c000' >The next morning I passed the tiny villa
where the jolly breakfast had occurred. It was
closed; roses still bloomed in the tangled garden;
a sign over the porch read: “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À louer.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c000' >The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bouffes-Parisiennes</span> had opened.</p>

 <img src='images/i_318.jpg' alt='' class='c015' />
</div>

<p class='c000' >Twilight found me at the Mureaux at the
opening of a pale blue-and-gold hotel with a
pretty, formal garden running to the river’s edge
and a banquet grove in
the rear. I was informed
by the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître
d’hôtel</span></i> that “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout Paris</span></i>”
would be present the
next day. There was
to be a grand regatta
and speeches by eminent
Parisian sportsmen
for whom sixty
covers were to be laid
in the grove. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame</span>
ran the hotel, continued
this important personage;
he had nothing to do with that, he had
charge of the restaurant only, but that was
enough. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parbleu!</span></i> He flew about, pale and
distracted, his shining bald pate in odd contrast
to his black side-whiskers, which I presumed
were dyed, since he had easily passed
through sixty years, most of them in watching
other people’s dinners. The place was in a
state of demoralization. The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître d’hôtel</span></i>
swore: waiters hired for the coming event pottered
around, picking up this and that and letting
it drop—as useless as the clown in the circus
who gets in every one’s way. All the furniture
in the hotel seemed to have been unloaded at
once and distributed by the delivery man. There
were Louis XVI. clocks in the bedrooms, ornaments
placed in impossible places, gorgeously
carved canopied bedsteads for which the mattresses
had been forgotten. It grew dark; and
there had been trouble with the gas company—and
there were no candles. A small printed
sign on my door read,</p>

<p class='c000' >I tried the top line and waited; nothing happened.
Then I pushed twice for the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femme de
chambre</span></i>, but no white-capped Marie came tripping
down the Brussels-carpeted hall to knock
gently at my door. Then I pushed vigorously
three times for the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</span></i>. He had refused the
job, I afterwards learned, and was at his home in
Touraine. At the end of twenty minutes a boy
carrying a gilt tête-à-tête chair to the room
above heard my cries.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Candles, you imbecile!” I shouted; “don’t
you see it is dark here?”</p>

<p class='c000' >He stared at me stupidly for a moment and
exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah! si, si! les bougies!</span></i>” and went clattering
down the stairs.</p>

<p class='c000' >In ten minutes he returned.</p>

<p class='c000' >“Did you find any?” I roared.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, oui! monsieur, parfaitement!</span></i> Two, but the
cook is using them.”</p>

<p class='c000' >The morning dawned chill and gray; already
some of the visitors had arrived. Some were
heavy, serious-looking gentlemen in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duc d’Orléans</span>
beards and yachting clothes. Others wore
a judicial air more in
keeping with their costume,
which included top
hats and frock coats.
Flags and pennants fluttered
from the terraces.
Bunting draped from the
shield of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">République
Française</span> ornamented
the judges’ stand from
which the prizes were to
be given.</p>

<p class='c000' >Orders were shouted on
the river through megaphones for the laying of
the course. The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître d’hôtel</span></i> looked haggard
and careworn. He gave orders which were
never carried out.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Imbécile</span></i>, have you prepared your butter?”
he cried to one of his staff, a clean-shaven little
man whose face bore the intelligence of a ground
mole. “Idiot,” he bawled at a third, “didn’t I
tell you the six-franc ducks were on the left side
of the cold room back of the two-franc <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pâtés de
foie gras</span></i>?”</p>

<p class='c000' >Only the two chefs hired from Paris seemed
placid. They stirred their sauces, poked up their
fires, and then leaned out of their kitchen window
as coolly as an engineer and fireman waiting for
orders to go ahead. It was noon. The crowd
along the terrace was cheering. The rowers
had arrived—a score of spindle-legged youths
with their overcoats thrown over their shoulders
to protect them from the chill wind. Bleak
clouds hung heavily in the northwest. Suddenly
came a blinding flash of lightning, the
thunder boomed, and down came the rain.</p>

<p class='c000' >It struck in sheets in the garden and drenched
the beautiful blue-and-gold hotel and the waiting
crowd, and pattered the river into a dull leaden
gray.</p>

<p class='c000' >It filled the wine-glasses and the soup-plates
for the feast of sixty, formed in little pools around
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors d’oeuvres</span></i>, and soaked the linen. It totally
demoralized the head waiter, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span> the
proprietress, and the regatta. But the two chefs
leaning out of their window again, smiled. They
had been paid.</p>

<p class='c000' >I made out my bill, had it approved by the now
hysterical <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span>, jumped into my boat and
pulled away from the wreck. A mile below, a
team passed me rattling along in the direction
of the railroad station. On the front seat a bald-headed
man with a newspaper bundle under his
arm was gesticulating wildly to the driver. It
was the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître d’hôtel</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000' >Below the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mureaux</span> upon an island I came
across a small cabin of a restaurant in the
middle of a garden patch. Seine nets were drying
in the door-yard, and under the eaves of the
house ran a sign reading in large letters <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">AU
GOUJON FOLICHON</span>.</p>

<p class='c000' >There was another excellent omelet to be had,
and a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">friture de Seine</span></i> of fresh and foolish <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">goujons</span></i>
whose greediness early that very morning had
proved their ruin. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame</span> in charge of this
fisherman’s rest showed me her strawberry
patch, still bearing fruit—quite a rarity for the
season.</p>

<p class='c000' >She had a brother-in-law in Brooklyn, America,
did I know him? She insisted upon generously
giving me all of her ripe strawberries. I
must tell her brother-in-law if I met him I had
seen her.</p>

<p class='c000' >When I pushed off down the river the chimney
of the Goujon Folichon was smoking with the
frying of more ill-fated foolish goujons, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madame</span>
was waving <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon voyage</span></i> from the window.</p>

<p class='c000' >There was a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span> at Limay. The only hotel
in this apology for a town was shaken by the
trampling feet of dancing swains when I arrived.
They informed me that the ball would continue
all night and the next day. Inside the ballroom
the town band pumped away amid the discordant
shrieking of two cheap clarinets, the drone
of a mournful baritone horn, and the thump of a
bass drum. The effort was anything but conducive
to sleep. I crossed the bridge and entered
Mantes, a splendidly built old city with a rare
Gothic cathedral.</p>

<p class='c000' >Later in the evening I returned to Limay.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span> was in full swing, so was the ball. Festoons
of lanterns were strung across the main
street. I followed the crowd up the cobble-stoned
hill to a small square back of a church.
Here shooting galleries popped away and
wheels of fortune whizzed for prizes. A patient
horse ground simultaneously the organ and a
merry-go-round. At the sound of a ta-ra-ta-ta of
trumpets in the distance, the excited crowd
rushed back to the top of the cobble-stoned hill
and waited breathlessly with flushed cheeks and
dancing eyes. The great parade had started.
Cherry branches bearing lanterns flared in advance
of the column. Nearer they came. I could
see the flashing of brass helmets. In a moment
they had passed—eight <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pompiers</span></i>, the noble
volunteer fire brigade of the town—amid cheers
and sighs of regret from the crowd that it was
all over. Not for another year would Limay
blaze in glory.</p>

<p class='c000' >A fair wind the next day filled my sail as far as
Vetheuil. The river had accommodatingly taken
a favorable turn, for the wind itself never seemed
to vary. It was a pleasant surprise after so
much rowing. Vetheuil seems to have been built
upon the stepping-stones which lead to its picturesque
cathedral. At the original inn of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cheval Blanc</span> there was a party of good bohemians:
two painters from Montmartre and their
models. They returned for dinner after a day’s
fishing, sunburned and happy, and filled the
dingy apartment that served for both billiard
and dining-room with their songs.</p>

<p class='c000' >There was something imposing in the name
of the inn at Bosnières—“The Grand Hotel of
the Two Hemispheres.” From my room over
the stable I could watch the life and bustle below
in the tiny court. My modest arrival seemed
to throw this hostelry with the all-embracing
name into a state of confusion.</p>

was milking the cow under my suite was pressed
into service to secure a cutlet from the neighboring

was served.</p>

<p class='c000' >Here was an excellent system by which to
avoid heavy losses through overstocking. The
Grand Hotel of the Two Hemispheres controlled
it to a nicety.</p>

<p class='c000' >Sixty kilometers still lay between Bosnières
and Rouen. The wind which had freshened in the
night, was blowing its contrariest, and progress
down the river proved slow. A steam-tow came
round a bend, the white and green funnel of the
tug belching a saffron smoke, which indicated
full speed. I got out my thirty meters of rope
and waited. I could see the fat red-faced pilot
of the steam-tug shaking his head at me in the
negative.</p>

<p class='c000' >“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voulez-vouz me remorquer?</span></i>” I cried.</p>

me an encouraging wink. The next instant we

around a stanchion. The little boat reared out

I jumped for the rudder.</p>
